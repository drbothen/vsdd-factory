//! POLICY 15 ATTESTATION-LOCATION GATE — binary entry point.
//!
//! Invocation (for CI):
//!
//! ```text
//! policy15-attestation-gate [BASE_BRANCH]
//! ```
//!
//! Defaults to `develop`; the `BASE_BRANCH` environment variable also sets the default.
//! Prints the outcome identifier to stdout (greppable in CI logs) and exits with
//! the appropriate process code:
//!
//! | Outcome | Exit code |
//! |---------|-----------|
//! | `PASS-N-activations` | 0 |
//! | `PASS-zero-activations` | 0 |
//! | `FAIL: obligation violated` | 2 |
//! | `EMPTY-or-UNREACHABLE: *` | 2 |
//! | Hard error (git not found, I/O) | 1 |
//!
//! GitHub Actions job name: `policy-15-attestation-location`
//! (see ADR-040 §Decision 7 Ruling 7(a)). The gate is ratified (ADR-040 v1.18,
//! active); only CI wiring of this job remains pending (D-969).
