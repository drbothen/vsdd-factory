//! arm_a1.rs — Class A Arm1: BC frontmatter version vs BC-INDEX.md row version.
//!
//! Effectful-shell module (ADR-035 §Decision 1): reads BC-INDEX.md via
//! `host::read_file` as a secondary read.
//!
//! # Behavior
//! Fires when a BC file is written. Reads BC-INDEX.md and compares the version
//! cell in the table row for this BC's ID against the BC frontmatter `version:`
//! field. Blocks if the INDEX row is stale (present but different), advisory-only
//! if the BC is new (v1.0 and not yet in the INDEX).
//!
//! # Fail-closed (BC-5.39.008 v1.6 / BC-5.39.010 invariant 4/5)
//! - `CapabilityDenied` on BC-INDEX.md → Block (sandbox misconfiguration).
//! - `NotFound` on BC-INDEX.md → Advisory + Continue (bootstrap ordering).
//! - Primary target (BC file) read failure → Block always (invariant 4).
//!   Primary target failure is handled in `lib.rs` before dispatching here.

    //
    // Root cause: `run_arm_a1_with_index_result` compares `index_version == bc_version`
    // without stripping the leading `v` from bc_version. When the BC frontmatter carries
    // `version: "v1.3"` (leading v), the extracted index_version is "1.3" but bc_version
    // is "v1.3". The strings differ; `parse_version("v1.3")` then fails because the `v`
    // prefix causes `"v1".parse::<u32>()` to return Err. Parse failure is treated as PC2b
    // → false block.
    //
    // Three root causes in these four bugs:
    //   019a → normalization (strip v-prefix from bc_version before comparison)
    //   019b + 019c → last-wins vs first-cell anchoring (same root cause — last v-token
    //                 in the entire field 6 text, not the first token of the last chain entry)

    //           creates phantom field boundaries, displacing the version field)
