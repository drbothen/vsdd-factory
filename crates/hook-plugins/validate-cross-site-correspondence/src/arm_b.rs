//! `host::read_file` when processing story file writes (Arm B1).
//!
//! # Two sub-arms
//!
//! ## B1 — story file write trigger
//! Fires when a story file is written. Extracts B1 (story frontmatter `input-hash:`),
//! reads STORY-INDEX.md to extract B2 (catalog row hash) and B3 (blockquote hash).
//! Blocks if any pair disagrees. Advisory if B2/B3 are absent (new story, not yet
//! registered in STORY-INDEX.md).
//!
//! ## B2 — STORY-INDEX.md write trigger
//! Fires when STORY-INDEX.md is written. Parses all story IDs and hash tokens from
//! the catalog rows and aggregation blockquote within the file itself. Blocks if any
//! catalog hash disagrees with the corresponding blockquote hash (cascade).
//!
//! # Block message invariant (BC-5.39.010 invariant 11)
//! The B1 block message MUST include a provenance note distinguishing:
//! - `stale` — B2/B3 likely just need a `--update` sweep
//! - `fabricated` — B1 disagrees with B3 but agrees with B2, suggesting B1 was
//!   manually edited without updating the story file
