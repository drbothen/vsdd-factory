//! arm_a2.rs — Class A Arm2: story body BC-version citations vs BC frontmatter.
//!
//! Effectful-shell module (ADR-035 §Decision 1): reads cited BC files via
//! `host::read_file` using the deterministic `derive_bc_path` path derivation
//! (no `host::list_dir`, no filesystem enumeration).
//!
//! # Behavior
//! Fires when a story file is written. For each BC listed in `behavioral_contracts:`,
//! extracts version tokens from table rows in the story body that cite that BC ID.
//! Compares each cited version against the BC frontmatter `version:` field (read
//! from the deterministically-derived path). Blocks if any cited version is stale.
//! Cascades: all stale citations are collected and reported in ONE combined block.
//!
//! # Key design invariants
//! - Path derivation: ONLY `derive_bc_path` (from arm_a1); NO `read_dir`/`glob`.
//! - Version token extraction: two-phase (BC-5.39.010 §PC13) — Phase 1 is
//!   BC-ID-anchored (ADV-RECON-003 / ADV-RECON2-001): a row is eligible for Phase 1
//!   pure-version-field extraction (`^v?([0-9]+\.[0-9]+)$`, rightmost field) ONLY when
//!   the row's own first field names the target BC (the same strong locator predicate
//!   normative for Arm1, `arm_a1::first_cell_matches_bc_id`). Phase 2 (BC-ID-anchored
//!   first `\bv([0-9]+\.[0-9]+)\b` after the BC ID) runs BOTH as the fallback for an
//!   eligible row with no pure-version field AND directly for an ineligible row —
//!   table rows only.
//! - Skip (not block) on: missing citations in table rows, NotFound BC files.
//! - Block on: present-but-stale citations, CapabilityDenied on BC reads.
//! - Cascade: single combined block when multiple BCs have stale citations.
//!
//! # BC trace
//! BC-5.39.010 preconditions 9-15; postconditions 7-11; invariant 1 (no enumeration).
