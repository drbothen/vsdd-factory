//! BC-3.07.001: sink-http exponential backoff with jitter between 5xx retries (S-4.09).
//!
//! Covers acceptance criteria AC-004 through AC-010 that require a running HTTP
//! mock server or timing assertions. Pure-formula tests (AC-001, AC-002, AC-003,
//! AC-006, AC-009 count) live in `crates/sink-http/src/retry.rs #[cfg(test)]`.
//!
//! ## Deterministic sleep assertion strategy
//!
//! All tests that previously asserted on wall-clock elapsed time now use
//! `HttpSink::new_with_recording_sleeper` + `RecordingSleepLog`. The recording
//! sleeper records every sleep duration requested by the retry loop and returns
//! immediately, making the test fully deterministic: we assert on WHETHER a sleep
//! was requested and for HOW LONG, not on measured wall-clock elapsed time.
//!
//! The one exception is `test_BC_3_07_001_sleep_does_not_hold_mutex` (AC-008):
//! that test verifies that `take_failures()` is not blocked while the worker is
//! mid-sleep. It intentionally uses `RealSleeper` (via `HttpSink::new`) so there
//! is an actual sleep window during which the mutex must be acquirable.
