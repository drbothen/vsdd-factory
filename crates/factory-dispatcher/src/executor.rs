//! Tiered parallel execution of matched plugins (S-1.6).
//!
//! Consumers of this module hand it the ordered tiers produced by
//! [`crate::routing::group_by_priority`] and get back a
//! [`TierExecutionSummary`] that records every plugin's outcome plus a
//! dispatcher-level exit code.
//!
//! Within a tier: plugins run concurrently via tokio tasks; each task
//! wraps the synchronous [`crate::invoke::invoke_plugin`] in
//! `spawn_blocking` so wasmtime is never blocking the runtime. Between
//! tiers: the dispatcher awaits every task before the next tier begins,
//! preserving priority ordering.
//!
//! Advisory-block semantics (per Q3 resolution + W-15 gate fix CRIT-PR59-001):
//! a plugin that writes `{"outcome":"block","reason":"..."}` to stdout
//! records a dispatcher-level block intent regardless of `on_error` setting.
//! The `on_error` field governs fail-closed semantics for crash and timeout:
//! a sync-group plugin that Crashes or times out with `on_error=Block` triggers
//! fail-closed exit 2 (ADR-019 §Decision 2). Async hooks never trigger fail-closed
//! (async block verdicts are advisory-only per ADR-019). The summary's
//! `exit_code` is 2 iff any block intent was recorded.
