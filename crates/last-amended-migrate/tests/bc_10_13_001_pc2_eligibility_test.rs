//! This file previously (v1.0) tested a `[Prior: ...]` chain as
//! `NotEligiblePriorChain` / `Err(MigrateError::NotEligible)` — the tool
//! refused to touch such a file. BC-10.13.001's v1.1 human-directed
//! amendment reframes this: an inline chain is now ELIGIBLE and gets SPLIT
//! (PC7) in the same migration run, making the tool a full replacement for
//! the one-time D-1149 POL-3 exception (S-15.03 AC-010). The tests below
//! were rewritten accordingly; `NotEligible` is now reserved exclusively for
//! EC-008 (a `last_amended` field that cannot be located in frontmatter at
//! all — a malformed-frontmatter condition, never a chain-length or
//! chain-presence condition).
