//! Error taxonomy for `last-amended-migrate`.
//!
//! Named error variants for every fallible operation this crate performs, per
//! CLAUDE.md's "No `unwrap()`/`expect()` in critical code paths" convention.
//! Pure data declarations — the BC-5.38.001 `todo!()` obligation governs
//! function *bodies*, not type/variant declarations, so these are written out
//! in full at stub stage (mirrors every sibling crate's `error.rs`/`lib.rs`
//! error-enum convention, e.g. `factory-lock`, `validate-dispatch-advance`).
