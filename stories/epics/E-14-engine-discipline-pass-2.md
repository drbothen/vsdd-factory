# Epic E-14: Engine Discipline Pass-2 — Process-Gap Remediation

## Description

Closes the five process-gap findings surfaced during F5 pass-1 adversarial review
of the v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1 cycle (adv-cycle-pass-1.md). These gaps
are not implementation defects in the cycle's deliverables (E-12/E-13) — they are
structural weaknesses in the factory pipeline itself: the adversary dispatch workflow,
the convergence state protocol, the pre-F5 lint gate, policy rubric injection, and
the pr-manager step-completion discipline.

E-12 (Engine Governance) and E-13 (Artifact Integrity) codified per-story adversary
convergence and artifact path discipline. E-14 completes the triangle by hardening
the dispatch and validation infrastructure that E-12/E-13 depend on to function
correctly at scale. Without E-14, the F5/F7 workflow has latent friction points that
will recur in every subsequent cycle.

**Critical sequencing note:** S-14.01 (bootstrap convergence-state backfill) MUST
complete before F7 close-out of v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1 — its absence
causes CONVERGENCE_STATE_MISSING for the 3 bootstrap stories on the next wave-gate
dispatch. All other stories in E-14 (S-14.02 through S-14.05) are forward-looking
improvements for the pass-2 cycle and have no blocking dependency on F7 close.

## PRD Capabilities Covered

| Capability ID | Name | Priority |
|--------------|------|----------|
| CAP-016 | Self-referential process codification via adversarial review | P1 |
| CAP-026 | Enforce per-story adversarial convergence as a pipeline gate | P1 |

## Capability Anchor Justification

**CAP-016 anchor:** All five stories in E-14 are process codification artifacts —
documenting and automating factory workflow behaviors that currently depend on manual
memory or luck. This matches CAP-016's intent ("Self-referential process codification
via adversarial review") as established in E-12.

**CAP-026 anchor:** S-14.01 (state backfill), S-14.02 (dispatch automation), and
S-14.04 (policy rubric injection) directly extend the convergence enforcement
infrastructure established by E-12. S-14.03 (pre-F5 lint) and S-14.05 (pr-manager
step discipline) are guard-rails on the pipeline that ensures convergence evidence
is well-formed before reaching the gate.

## Subsystem Anchors

- **SS-05 (Pipeline Orchestration):** S-14.01 (convergence state file authoring),
  S-14.02 (F5 phase skill / lobster step automation), S-14.04 (adversary dispatch
  pre-injection step), S-14.05 (pr-manager step discipline — per-story-delivery.md
  and orchestrator AGENT.md changes). All touch pipeline workflow files under
  `plugins/vsdd-factory/workflows/phases/` or `plugins/vsdd-factory/agents/`.
- **SS-04 (Plugin Ecosystem):** S-14.03 (pre-F5 lint hook or WASM validation).
- **SS-06 (Skill Catalog):** S-14.02 (updates F5 adversarial-refinement skill or
  adds an orchestration wrapper), S-14.04 (updates adversary dispatch skill step).

## Stories Planned

| Story | Title | Size | Subsystem | Priority | Delivery Order |
|-------|-------|------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| S-14.01 | Bootstrap convergence-state backfill (PG-2) | XS | SS-05 | **P0 — BLOCKING for F7** | FIRST (before F7 close-out) |
| S-14.02 | F5 dispatch → state-manager persist automation (PG-1) | S | SS-05, SS-06 | P1 | Second in pass-2 cycle |
| S-14.03 | Pre-F5 artifact lint for placeholder frontmatter (PG-3) | S | SS-04 | P2 | Third |
| S-14.04 | Policy-rubric auto-injection for adversary dispatch (PG-4) | S | SS-05 | P1 | Fourth |
| S-14.05 | pr-manager Step-4/Step-5 early-exit codification (PG-6) | M | SS-05 | P1 | Fifth |

## Dependency Topology

```
S-14.01 (bootstrap backfill) ── F7 gate ──► F7 close-out + next wave-gate unblocked
                                               │
                                               ▼
S-14.02 (dispatch automation) ──────────────► pass-2 dispatch
         │
         ▼
S-14.04 (policy-rubric injection) ──────────► pass-2 dispatch
         │
         ▼
S-14.03 (pre-F5 lint) ──────────────────────► pass-2 dispatch
         │
         ▼
S-14.05 (pr-manager discipline) ─────────────► pass-2 dispatch
```

S-14.01 is the only story with a hard dependency on F7 timing. S-14.02 through
S-14.05 can be delivered in any order within the pass-2 cycle, but the recommended
delivery sequence is S-14.02 → S-14.04 → S-14.03 → S-14.05 (highest → lowest
impact on convergence evidence quality).

## Anchored ADRs

| ADR ID | Title |
|--------|-------|
| ADR-017 | Per-story adversary three-perimeter model + phasing |

## Process-Gap Source Mapping

| Story | F5 Finding | Adversary Observation |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| S-14.01 | F-LOW-3 (OBS-3) | Bootstrap cohort lacks convergence-state files; F7 must backfill |
| S-14.02 | F-LOW-2 (OBS-2) | F5 dispatch assumes adversary writes; contradicts read-only profile |
| S-14.03 | F-LOW-4 + F-LOW-5 (OBS-5/6) | Pre-F5 placeholder lint check missing; input-hash drift not enforced |
| S-14.04 | F-MED-9 | Policy-rubric injection into adversary dispatch is manual |
| S-14.05 | PG-6 (orchestrator-observed) | pr-manager exits mid-flow after Step 4 or Step 5 |

## Open Questions

| OQ ID | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| OQ-E14-01 | SS-04 | S-14.03: implement as a WASM hook (PreToolUse on adversary dispatch), a bats lint script, or a skill preamble check? Decision needed before S-14.03 implementation. |
| OQ-E14-02 | SS-05 | S-14.02: does the phase-5 lobster step need a new `capture-adversary-output` step, or should the phase-5 skill itself dispatch state-manager as a sub-step? The orchestrator skill model may constrain this. |
| OQ-E14-03 | SS-05 | S-14.05: pr-manager discipline — invert control (orchestrator drives steps) vs add STEP_COMPLETE sentinel vs add hard validation gate at Step 4/5 exit point. Decision required before S-14.05 implementation. |

## CHANGELOG

| Version | Date | Change |
|---------|------|--------|
| v1.0 | 2026-05-07 | Initial authoring (product-owner; B6 process-gap burst from F5 pass-1 adversarial review of v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1). Five stories authored: S-14.01 (P0 BLOCKING), S-14.02-05 (P1-P2 pass-2). Delivery order: S-14.01 before F7 close-out; S-14.02-05 in next cycle. |
