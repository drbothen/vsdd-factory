Linear delivery order: S-13.01 → S-12.01 → S-12.02. All tdd_mode strict. Total 38 ACs anchored to BC-4.10.001-002, BC-4.11.001, BC-5.39.001-002, BC-6.22.001 + VPs 069/070/071/072. OQ-9 (BC-4.10.001 vs VP-071 hook semantics) resolved by VP-071 v1.0→v1.1 amendment to canonical block_with_fix pattern (D-349). F4 entry gate clear. Next: F4 TDD implementation, beginning with S-13.01 (path governance) which has hard sequencing as block-mode hook."

## Convergence Summary — E-9 v1.7 Amendment Sweep

**Status:** CONVERGENCE_REACHED at D-308 (2026-05-06; pass-63 NITPICK_ONLY)

**Final state:**
- E-9 epic version: v1.53 (HEAD: post-D-308 commit)
- BC-1.05.035 + BC-1.05.036: convergence-grade
- ADR-013 protocol: 3-pass NITPICK_ONLY chain achieved (61 → 62 → 63)
- Total iterations: 63 adversary passes; 28 fix bursts
- Codified TD-VSDD rules: 36+ entries (TD-VSDD-053..093 + pattern-tracking)
- Story-index: v2.15

**Pass-63 angle progression (final 3 NITPICK chain):**
- pass-61 (D-306): Date coherence audit
- pass-62 (D-307): HTML/special-character/escape-sequence audit
- pass-63 (D-308): Cross-reference acyclicity audit

**Step (iv) closure:** All TD-VSDD-088 META-routing applied; TD-VSDD-091 stable-anchor citations consistent; TD-VSDD-092 BC-SOUL4-coverage applied; TD-VSDD-093 closure-narrative source-of-truth validation codified and applied (4 PO + adversary applications). POLICY 1 append-only preserved across all 53 historical H3 blocks.

**Step (v) UNBLOCKED:** PO BC authorship for S-10.01..S-10.09 (9 BCs covering E-10 single-stream OTel emit contract per ADR-015 D-15.1/D-15.2/D-15.3/D-15.4).

## Current Phase Steps

| Step | Agent | Status | Output |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| *(earlier steps archived to cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/burst-log.md)* | | | |
| **D-337 state-manager seal — pass-8 fix-cycle** | state-manager | **COMPLETE** | BC-INDEX 1.13→1.14 (16 BC version pins); STORY-INDEX 2.22→2.23 (S-10.05 1.4→1.5); E-10-pass-8.md created; STATE.md + lessons.md sealed. Pass-9 is next dispatch (PAUSED). |
| **D-340 F2 spec evolution — engine-discipline-pass-1** | product-owner + architect + state-manager | **COMPLETE** | 6 BCs (BC-5.39.001/002 SS-05; BC-4.10.001/002 + BC-4.11.001 SS-04; BC-6.22.001 SS-06). ADR-016 + ADR-017. VP-069..072. PRD 1.0→1.1 (FR-047). BC-INDEX 1.14→1.15; ARCH-INDEX 1.7→1.8; VP-INDEX 1.0→1.1. total_bcs 1931→1937. current_cycle flipped. Next: F3 (3 stories: C path governance, A workflow+agent docs, B WASM hook). |
| **E-11 authoring + indexing burst (orphan-hook anchor) — D-11.7** | product-owner (E-11 epic) + state-manager (indexing) | **COMPLETE** | E-11 epic v1.0/draft authored (491L; 8 stories S-11.01..S-11.08; target v1.3); collision resolved: S-11.00 already registered as verify-sha-currency.sh stub (D-297); E-11 stories renumbered +1 (S-11.01..S-11.08); STORY-INDEX 2.23→2.24 (8 new rows + 8 pointer updates S-8.20–S-8.27 re-pointed to E-11); E-11 frontmatter story_count corrected 7→8. |
| **E-11 epic v1.1 amendment — sync body to STORY-INDEX renumber** | product-owner (epic body) + state-manager (commit) | **COMPLETE (25b3c20)** | E-11 epic body v1.0→v1.1: all live story-pointer refs renumbered S-11.00..S-11.07 → S-11.01..S-11.08 to match STORY-INDEX (14bb9c4). CHANGELOG v1.1 entry + narrative appended. Verification: zero live S-11.00 refs; dependency graph topology preserved. No semantic changes. |
| **D-349 F3 story decomposition — v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1** | product-owner (epics E-12/E-13) + story-writer (S-13.01/S-12.01/S-12.02) + state-manager (indexing + commit) | **COMPLETE** | E-12 Engine Governance (S-12.01/S-12.02) + E-13 Artifact Integrity (S-13.01). 38 ACs total. Linear: S-13.01→S-12.01→S-12.02. All tdd_mode strict. STORY-INDEX 2.24→2.25. D-345..D-348 logged. OQ-9 surfaced (VP-071 vs BC-4.10.001 discrepancy; pre-F4 gate). |

## Session Resume Checkpoint

**Last update:** 2026-05-07 — PAUSE POINT. D-337 sealed pass-8 fix-cycle. rc.13 cut attempted and FAILED (perf-baseline.bats). User-requested pause before pass-9.

**factory-artifacts HEAD:** 374b398 (D-337 seal — run `git -C .factory log -1 --format='%h %s'` to confirm)
**develop HEAD:** ba63c9f (PR #96 squash-merge — release CI Slice 3 reason code test alignment)
**main HEAD:** fb3e297 (rc.11 bot bundle; behind develop)
**v1.0.0-rc.13 tag (remote):** PINNED at ba63c9f — INVALID (validate fails; user must delete: `git push origin :refs/tags/v1.0.0-rc.13`)
**v1.0.0-rc.12 tag:** 4cf59bc; SHIPPED 2026-05-06
**v1.0.0-rc.11 tag:** fb3e297; GH prerelease=true; PRs #89/#90/#91 merged 2026-05-04
**Active worktrees:** main + .factory only
**Stash on develop:** stash@{0} = perf-baseline.bats one-line fix (git rev-parse --show-toplevel); restore with `git stash pop`
**E-9 current version:** v1.53 (CONVERGENCE_REACHED; ADR-013 clock 3_of_3; D-308)
**E-10 BC authorship:** COMPLETE (D-313 SEALED; 13 BCs across SS-01/SS-02/SS-03/SS-04; total_bcs 1931)
**E-10 convergence counter:** 0-of-3 (3 consecutive NITPICK_ONLY required; pass-8 was HIGH)
**E-10 finding trend:** 22 → 11 → 16 → 16 → 12 → 2 → 1 → 4
**BC-INDEX:** v1.14 | **STORY-INDEX:** v2.23 | **ARCH-INDEX:** v1.7

**ACTIVE STEP: PAUSED — next dispatch is adversary pass-9 (Path A) or perf-baseline fix PR (Path B)**

**Path A pickup:** Dispatch `vsdd-factory:adversary` pass-9 on post-D-337 spec package at factory-artifacts=374b398. Axes CC/DD/EE VERIFIED CLEAN per pass-8. New axes FF (DI-017 sweep completeness) + GG (schema_version differentiation) to verify. If NITPICK_ONLY → counter 0→1.

**Path B pickup:** `git stash pop` on develop → `git checkout -b fix/perf-baseline-abspath` → commit + push → PR #97 → pr-manager. After merge: USER must delete remote rc.13 tag, then re-cut rc.13.

**F-7 + F-8 status:** Deferred to cleanup stories #115/#116. Do NOT re-include in adversary scope.
**S-11.00 backlog:** verify-sha-currency.sh Rust port stub (D-297). Full authoring: post-E-10 convergence.
