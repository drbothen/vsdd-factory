**Summary:** Addressed 6 findings from pass-8 MEDIUM verdict (regression from pass-7 LOW). ARCH-INDEX v1.44→v1.45: cite-refresh per L-P20-002 triggered by BC-INDEX v1.63→v1.64 bump in pass-7 burst (F-P8-001). E-14 v1.1→v1.2: forward-ref note corrected — S-14.01 explicitly identified as pass-1 cycle (not pass-2 as erroneously stated); S-14.02..S-14.09 forward-referenced as pass-2 (F-P8-002). STATE.md comprehensive update: phase, current_step, Phase Progress (rows for passes 3-8), Session Resume Checkpoint, Index versions updated per D-381 initial application (F-P8-003). STORY-INDEX last_amended field updated to document v2.65 bump event with S-14.06-09 registration (F-P8-004). burst-log.md: entries for passes 3-7 appended retroactively (F-P8-005).

NOTE: ARCH-INDEX cite-refresh (L-P20-002) was missed in the pass-7 fix burst — this burst applied the retroactive fix.
