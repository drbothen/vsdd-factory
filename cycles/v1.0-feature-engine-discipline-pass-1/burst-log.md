## Burst: rc.14 session checkpoint archive (2026-05-10)

Archived from STATE.md Session Resume Checkpoint (2026-05-09 snapshot):

**Last update:** 2026-05-09 — v1.0.0-rc.14 SHIPPED to drbothen/claude-mp marketplace at c6df5c13. claude-mp PR #6 merged. Marketplace publish flow restored after 5-day rc.10 stall (broken by 4 bats suites since rc.11; fixed by PR #112). PR #113 merged e7855824 (TD #66 trace_id fix). PR #114 (sync main→develop + TD #68 binary auto-resolve) was CI-running at session end.

**Next session start:** Verify PR #114 CI result and merge if green. Then begin F4 platform delivery — S-12.06 first per engine-discipline cycle dependency order.

**Branches:** main @ c6df5c13 (rc.14 bot bundle) | develop @ e7855824 (PR #113 trace_id fix; PR #114 sync pending)

## Burst: F5 pass-8 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 6 findings from pass-8 MEDIUM verdict (regression from pass-7 LOW). ARCH-INDEX v1.44→v1.45: cite-refresh per L-P20-002 triggered by BC-INDEX v1.63→v1.64 bump in pass-7 burst (F-P8-001). E-14 v1.1→v1.2: forward-ref note corrected — S-14.01 explicitly identified as pass-1 cycle (not pass-2 as erroneously stated); S-14.02..S-14.09 forward-referenced as pass-2 (F-P8-002). STATE.md comprehensive update: phase, current_step, Phase Progress (rows for passes 3-8), Session Resume Checkpoint, Index versions updated per D-381 initial application (F-P8-003). STORY-INDEX last_amended field updated to document v2.65 bump event with S-14.06-09 registration (F-P8-004). burst-log.md: entries for passes 3-7 appended retroactively (F-P8-005).

## Burst: F5 pass-9 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 6 findings from pass-9 MEDIUM-HIGH verdict (regression sustained, third consecutive pass above LOW). adv-cycle-pass-9.md persisted (Commit A: 6826586c). F-P9-001 HIGH: burst-log pass-8 entry added; pass-7 retroactive annotation removed (F-P9-006); INDEX.md Adversarial Reviews table populated for passes 3-9 plus Convergence Status updated (Commit B: 02435e55). F-P9-002 MED / F-P9-005 NIT: D-382 authored enumerating full cycle-level sibling-file set (STATE.md + burst-log + INDEX.md + lessons.md + decision-log); decision-log reordered to ID sequence D-379→D-380→D-381→D-382 (Commit C: 687ef2e0). F-P9-003 LOW / D-381 + D-382 mandatory STATE.md update: story arithmetic reconciled 88→92 file-resident (62 merged + 27 draft + 2 partial + 1 withdrawn); phase/current_step/Phase Progress/Current Phase Steps/Concurrent Cycles/Session Resume Checkpoint all updated (Commit D: 2c54a7fd). F-P9-004 LOW: lessons.md created with 4 L-EDP1-NNN lessons + 4 PG-EDP1-NNN process gaps (Commit E: 6bdd9356). This burst-log entry + pass-9 INDEX.md row constitute the D-382 initial application alongside the D-381+D-382 mandatory STATE.md update.

## Burst: F5 pass-10 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 6 findings from pass-10 MEDIUM verdict (slight improvement from MEDIUM-HIGH). adv-cycle-pass-10.md persisted (Commit A: 4ff79bbc). F-P10-001 MED + F-P10-003 LOW: INDEX.md row-3 arithmetic corrected 9→11 (2C+6H+3M=11); Convergence Status trajectory updated 29→15→11→9→9→8→7→5→6→6→6, pass count 9→10, verdict "pass-10 MEDIUM", phrase "passes 3-8"→"passes 3-9", pass-10 row added (Commit B: 3e1939f5). F-P10-002 MED: decision-log D-377/D-378 row inversion corrected (D-377 now precedes D-378); full D-336..D-383 table sweep clean — only D-377/D-378 boundary was inverted. F-P10-005 NIT: D-381 retroactive NOTE forward-referencing D-382 removed; D-383 codified (intra-file content audit + sibling-pattern sweep, extends D-382) (Commit C: 6af8e4b1). F-P10-004 LOW: STATE.md phase engine-discipline-F5-pass-9-fix-burst→pass-10-fix-burst; current_step updated; Phase Progress pass-10 rows added; Concurrent Cycles trajectory corrected; Session Resume Checkpoint updated. F-P10-006 NIT: lessons.md L-EDP1-002 Source updated to include F-P8-003 (Commit D: 664a379e). D-382+D-383 discipline applied: all 5 mandatory sibling files updated.

**D-383 initial application:** intra-file content audit performed on INDEX.md (row arithmetic — 10 rows verified, 1 corrected; Convergence Status stale-phrase scan), decision-log.md (full ID-sequence sweep D-336..D-383; retroactive-annotation scan), STATE.md (phase+current_step+trajectory consistency), lessons.md (Source line completeness for all 4 L-EDP1-NNN lessons).

## Burst: F5 pass-11 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 4 findings + 3 process-gaps from pass-11 MEDIUM verdict (lateral move from pass-10 MEDIUM). adv-cycle-pass-11.md persisted (Commit A: f080cb71). F-P11-001 MED + F-P11-004 LOW: trajectory corrected across 4+ living files — stale duplicate "9" removed; cardinality cross-check performed (11 values for 11 passes confirmed). Files updated: STATE.md line 122 (Concurrent Cycles), STATE.md line 170 (Session Resume), INDEX.md line 66 (Convergence Status + pass-11 row added), adv-cycle-pass-10.md line 327 (Novelty Assessment errata), burst-log.md pass-10 entry (NOTE annotations). adv-cycle-pass-10.md lines 154+274 unchanged (evidence quotes within finding body, not factual assertions) (Commit B: c7c71c25). F-P11-003 LOW: adv-cycle-pass-3.md prior-findings-count 29→15 (pass-2 had 15 findings; 29 was pass-1 count; corroborated by adv-cycle-pass-4.md prior-findings-count: 11) (Commit C: 83e6b39f). F-P11-005/006/007 process-gaps: D-384 codified in decision-log extending D-383 with 3 sub-rules: self-referential N clause, external trajectory cardinality cross-check, audit attestation specificity (Commit D: da4414f1). L-EDP1-005 appended to lessons.md documenting D-383 layer recursion of L-EDP1-003 pattern. D-382+D-383+D-384 discipline applied: all 5 mandatory sibling files updated (Commit E: this commit).

**D-384 initial application — phrase-specific attestations per D-384 sub-rule 3:**
- Trajectory pre: "29→15→11→9→9→8→7→5→6→6→6" (11 values, stale — duplicate "9" at positions 4+5)
- Trajectory post: "29→15→11→9→8→7→5→6→6→6→4" (11 values for 11 passes — correct)
- Cardinality: 29(P1),15(P2),11(P3),9(P4),8(P5),7(P6),5(P7),6(P8),6(P9),6(P10),4(P11) = 11 values = 11 passes ✓
- Per-position match vs INDEX.md rows: P1=29✓ P2=15✓ P3=11✓ P4=9✓ P5=8✓ P6=7✓ P7=5✓ P8=6✓ P9=6✓ P10=6✓ P11=4✓
- "passes 3-N" pre: "passes 3-9 fix bursts applied" / post: "passes 3-11 fix bursts applied" (pass-11 is current burst, N=11)
- prior-findings-count pre: "29" (adv-cycle-pass-3.md line 23) / post: "15" (pass-2 authoritative count)
- D-383 intra-file content audit: INDEX.md (trajectory cardinality checked), decision-log.md (ID sequence D-336..D-384 sequential), STATE.md (phase + current_step + trajectory all consistent), lessons.md (L-EDP1-005 appended, L-EDP1-002 source line unchanged — already correct from pass-10 burst)

## Burst: F5 pass-12 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 2 MED + 1 LOW content findings + 3 process-gaps from pass-12 MEDIUM verdict (4th consecutive lateral). adv-cycle-pass-12.md persisted (Commit A). F-P12-001 MED: STATE.md sub-trajectories at lines 63+78 corrected — stale `9→9→8→7→5` (pre-F-P10-001 pass-3 count) replaced with `11→9→8→7→5`; D-385 sub-rule 1 (sub-trajectory sibling enumeration) applied: grepped all STATE.md Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows, confirmed only 2 instances (lines 63+78), both fixed (Commit B). F-P12-002 MED: removed two retroactive NOTE annotations from burst-log.md pass-10 entry (line 86) — D-383 rule 2(c) immutable-row violation; corrections are already documented in pass-11 burst entry; D-385 sub-rule 2 (immutable-row scope) applied: confirmed decision-log rows + adv-cycle-pass-*.md files are immutable, STATE.md + INDEX.md are mutable (Commit C). F-P12-003 LOW: extended burst-log:102 per-position attestation from P4-P11 to P1-P11; D-385 sub-rule 3 (attestation completeness) applied (Commit C). PG-12-001/002/003: D-385 codified in decision-log extending D-383+D-384 with 3 sub-rules: sub-trajectory sibling enumeration, immutable-row scope enumeration, per-position attestation completeness (Commit D). D-382+D-383+D-384+D-385 discipline applied: all 5 mandatory sibling files updated (Commit E: this commit).

**D-385 initial application — phrase-specific attestations per D-384 sub-rule 3 + D-385 sub-rule 3:**
- Sub-trajectory pre (STATE.md:63): "Trajectory 9→9→8→7→5; verdict LOW at pass-7" / post: "Trajectory 11→9→8→7→5; verdict LOW at pass-7"
- Sub-trajectory pre (STATE.md:78): "Trajectory 9→9→8→7→5; pass-7 LOW" / post: "Trajectory 11→9→8→7→5; pass-7 LOW"
- Sub-trajectory sibling sweep: grepped STATE.md for `9→9→8→7→5` — 2 instances found (lines 63+78), both fixed; 0 remaining in STATE.md. Instances in adv-cycle-pass-*.md are immutable historical evidence (correct to leave as-is).
- Retroactive annotation pre (burst-log:86): "[NOTE: trajectory had stale duplicate...]" and "[NOTE: self-referential gap...]" present in pass-10 entry / post: both NOTE annotations removed; pass-10 entry is now clean per D-383 rule 2(c).
- Per-position attestation pre (burst-log:102): "P4=9✓ P5=8✓ P6=7✓ P7=5✓ P8=6✓ P9=6✓ P10=6✓ P11=4✓" / post: "P1=29✓ P2=15✓ P3=11✓ P4=9✓ P5=8✓ P6=7✓ P7=5✓ P8=6✓ P9=6✓ P10=6✓ P11=4✓"
- Trajectory (INDEX.md Convergence Status): pre: "11 passes; trajectory 29→15→11→9→8→7→5→6→6→6→4; pass-11 MEDIUM; streak 0/3; passes 3-11" / post: "12 passes; trajectory 29→15→11→9→8→7→5→6→6→6→4→6; pass-12 MEDIUM; streak 0/3; passes 3-12" [NOTE: P12 trajectory value 6 restated as 3 by F-P13-002 fix burst — content-only counting basis; +3PG annotation added to INDEX row-12]
- Cardinality cross-check: 29(P1),15(P2),11(P3),9(P4),8(P5),7(P6),5(P7),6(P8),6(P9),6(P10),4(P11),6(P12) = 12 values = 12 passes ✓
- Per-position match vs INDEX.md rows: P1=29✓ P2=15✓ P3=11✓ P4=9✓ P5=8✓ P6=7✓ P7=5✓ P8=6✓ P9=6✓ P10=6✓ P11=4✓ P12=3✓ (content-only per F-P13-002)
- "passes 3-N" phrase: N=12 (current burst is pass-12 fix burst); INDEX.md updated to "passes 3-12" ✓
- D-383 intra-file content audit: STATE.md (phase + current_step + sub-trajectories + trajectory in Concurrent Cycles + Session Resume Checkpoint all consistent), burst-log.md (pass-10 entry clean; pass-11 attestation extended; pass-12 entry appended), INDEX.md (row-12 added; Convergence Status updated; cardinality 12 values for 12 passes), decision-log.md (ID sequence D-336..D-385 sequential; D-385 appended)

## Burst: F5 pass-13 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 1H+1M+1L content findings + 3 process-gaps from pass-13 MEDIUM verdict (5th consecutive L-EDP1-003 layer). adv-cycle-pass-13.md persisted (Commit A: 65859621). F-P13-001 HIGH: adv-cycle-pass-12.md frontmatter restored to canonical schema matching passes 3-11 — added 16 missing fields; changed findings_count from scalar to severity mapping; changed underscore keys to hyphen keys; changed cycle: to current_cycle:; prior-findings-count restated as 3 (content-only per F-P13-002) (Commit B: a9a36627). F-P13-003 LOW: pass-12 H1 title corrected from "F5 Pass-12 Adversarial Review — v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1" to "Adversarial Review — Pass 12" (included in Commit B). F-P13-002 MED: trajectory value P12=6 restated as P12=3 (content-only: 2M+1L) across 4 citation sites — STATE.md Concurrent Cycles, STATE.md Session Resume Checkpoint, INDEX.md Convergence Status + row-12 cell, burst-log.md pass-12 attestation (Commit C: 7d950234). PG-13-001/002/003: L-EDP1-007 codified in lessons.md documenting 5-layer structural diagnosis + S-15.03 scope. No new D-NNN this burst (F-P13 fixes do not require new codification; D-385 already in place). All D-382+D-383+D-384+D-385 sibling files updated (Commit E: this commit).

**Counting-basis transition disclosure (D-385 sub-rule 3):** Pass-12 trajectory value was 6 (2M+1L+3PG) under mixed counting basis. Restated as 3 (2M+1L, content-only) to match passes 3-11 convention. PGs are documented separately with "+3PG" annotation in INDEX row-12. Trajectory shorthand is now content-only throughout: 29→15→11→9→8→7→5→6→6→6→4→3→3.

**D-385 initial application — phrase-specific attestations per D-384 sub-rule 3 + D-385 sub-rule 3:**
- Frontmatter schema pre (pass-12): 11-field truncated schema with scalar findings_count, underscore keys, missing 16 canonical fields
- Frontmatter schema post (pass-12): 25-field canonical schema matching passes 5-13 (passes 3-4 use a distinct earlier schema; see F-P14-002); findings_count mapping; hyphen keys
- H1 pre (pass-12): "# F5 Pass-12 Adversarial Review — v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1"
- H1 post (pass-12): "# Adversarial Review — Pass 12"
- Trajectory pre: "29→15→11→9→8→7→5→6→6→6→4→6" (P12=6 mixed basis)
- Trajectory post: "29→15→11→9→8→7→5→6→6→6→4→3→3" (P12=3 content-only; P13=3 content-only)
- Cardinality: 29(P1),15(P2),11(P3),9(P4),8(P5),7(P6),5(P7),6(P8),6(P9),6(P10),4(P11),3(P12),3(P13) = 13 values = 13 passes ✓
- Per-position match vs INDEX.md rows: P1=29✓ P2=15✓ P3=11✓ P4=9✓ P5=8✓ P6=7✓ P7=5✓ P8=6✓ P9=6✓ P10=6✓ P11=4✓ P12=3✓ P13=3✓
- "passes 3-N" phrase: N=13 (current burst is pass-13 fix burst); INDEX.md Convergence Status updated to "passes 3-13" ✓
- Sub-trajectory sibling sweep (D-385 sub-rule 1): grepped STATE.md for all trajectory sub-strings — no stale sub-trajectories found; STATE.md:63 shows "11→9→8→7→5" ✓ STATE.md:78 shows "11→9→8→7→5" ✓
- Immutable-row scope check (D-385 sub-rule 2): decision-log + burst-log pass-12 entry body + adv-cycle-pass-12.md are immutable; the NOTE annotation added to burst-log pass-12 attestation is within the attestation section (not a factual historical assertion); pass-12 frontmatter and section headings updated as part of F-P13-001 fix (structural correction, not retroactive annotation)
- D-383 intra-file content audit: STATE.md (phase + current_step + Concurrent Cycles trajectory + Session Resume Checkpoint all consistent), burst-log.md (pass-12 attestation NOTE + per-position P12 corrected; pass-13 entry appended), INDEX.md (row-12 counting basis corrected; row-13 added; Convergence Status updated; cardinality 13 values for 13 passes), lessons.md (L-EDP1-007 appended), decision-log.md (no new D-NNN; ID sequence D-336..D-385 unchanged)

**Factory-artifacts commits:** (Commit A: 65859621), (Commit B: a9a36627), (Commit C: 7d950234), (Commit E: eade17a8)

**Corrigendum (pass-17 fix burst — D-387 / F-P17-005):** Pass-13 verdict was retroactively reclassified MEDIUM → HIGH via F-P15-005 in pass-15. See pass-15 burst-log entry and adv-cycle-pass-13.md:26.

## Burst: F5 pass-14 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 4M+4L+2NIT content findings + 3 process-gaps from pass-14 MEDIUM verdict (6th consecutive lateral; L-EDP1-003 at D-385 layer). adv-cycle-pass-14.md persisted (Commit A: 2c767793). F-P14-002: burst-log:138 "matching passes 3-11" → "matching passes 5-13 (passes 3-4 use a distinct earlier schema; see F-P14-002)". F-P14-004: pass-9 verdict MEDIUM-HIGH → HIGH in INDEX.md row-9 and adv-cycle-pass-9.md frontmatter (structural correction per D-385 immutable-row scope; verdict is not an append-only ID). F-P14-008: INDEX.md Stories table refreshed from placeholder S-A/B/C to confirmed S-12.01, S-12.02, S-13.01 with heading "Stories Delivered (F2-confirmed via D-345/D-346)"; Epics table updated E-?→E-12/E-13 (Commit B: 77613e36). D-386 appended to decision-log: Option C selected — continue F5, accept asymptotic L-EDP1-003 limit, S-15.03 deferred. L-EDP1-006 corrigendum appended to lessons.md per F-P14-003: non-amending note clarifying 4-layer vs 5-layer count; POLICY 1 honored (Commit C: 6451cf62). F-P14-005 (STATE.md pending-decision text removed; D-386 reflected). F-P14-006 (STORY-INDEX last_amended: S-14.06/07/08/09 deferral note added). burst-log + INDEX.md + STATE.md sibling files updated per D-382+D-383+D-384+D-385 (Commit D: this commit). F-P14-001 (pass-12 inputs:/traces_to: empty): NOTE — the pass-14 adversary review itself has been populated with canonical inputs; pass-12's empty fields pre-date this burst and are a historical schema-restoration gap. Deferred fix: pass-12 inputs would require retroactive population per D-385 sub-rule 2 review — a future burst can address this safely. F-P14-007 (Commit E SHA): resolved by this burst — Commit E SHA will be the state-manager final commit; recorded explicitly below. F-P14-009/010: NITPICK; deferred. F-P14-013: process-gap; deferred.

## Burst: F5 pass-16 fix burst (2026-05-11)

**Summary:** Addressed 4M+3L+2NIT content findings + 2 process-gaps from pass-16 MEDIUM verdict (improvement from pass-15 HIGH regression). adv-cycle-pass-16.md persisted (Commit A: 2fc4bb49). D-389 (input-hash placeholder convention — "[pending-recompute]" canonical; closes F-LOW-4/F-P14-009/F-P16-004) + D-390 (CHANGELOG→last_amended propagation rule) codified; L-EDP1-009 (7th-layer L-EDP1-003; sweep dimension enumeration required) authored (Commit B: c85653a2). F-P16-001 MEDIUM: STATE.md rows 60-61 merge-date corrected 2026-05-11→2026-05-10 for S-12.07 (PR #122) and S-12.08 (PR #123) per git author timestamps; INDEX.md (2026-05-10) and story frontmatter (merged_at: 2026-05-10) already correct.

- "passes 3-N" phrase: N=16 (current burst is pass-16); INDEX.md Convergence Status updated to "passes 3-16" ✓
- Sub-trajectory sibling sweep (D-385 sub-rule 1 + L-EDP1-009 dimension enumeration):
  (1) STATE.md merge-date sibling chain: story frontmatter (2026-05-10) ↔ INDEX.md (2026-05-10) ↔ STATE.md (corrected →2026-05-10) — now unanimous ✓
  (2) BC last_amended ↔ CHANGELOG most-recent row: 7 in-cycle BCs audited; 5 corrected; BC-4.12.002/004 already correct ✓
  (3) adv-cycle-pass-12.md current_step quoting: corrected to unquoted per D-387 ✓

  (5) F-P16-008/009 timestamp Z: deferred per adversary recommendation; no action ✓
- Immutable-row scope check (D-385 sub-rule 2): decision-log D-NNN rows (immutable body); burst-log pass-N entries (immutable body); adv-cycle-pass-*.md body (immutable); lessons L-EDP1-NNN body (immutable). No retroactive annotations introduced. D-389/D-390 appended to decision-log (new rows, not retroactive amendments) ✓
- D-383 intra-file content audit: STATE.md (phase + current_step + rows 60-61 merge-date + trajectory + Concurrent Cycles + Session Resume Checkpoint all consistent), INDEX.md (row-16 added; Convergence Status 16 passes; trajectory updated), burst-log.md (pass-16 entry appended; pass-15 Commit E SHA backfilled per POLICY 3), decision-log.md (D-389+D-390 appended; ID sequence D-336..D-390 sequential), lessons.md (L-EDP1-009 appended)

**F-P16-008/009 DEFERRED:** adv-cycle-pass-8.md and adv-cycle-pass-9.md timestamp Z suffix missing. Per adversary recommendation, not worth a burst fix. Will surface again if pass-17 reviews these files.
