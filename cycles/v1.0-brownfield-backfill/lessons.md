## LESSON-2026-05-04-001 [process-gap] Story marked "shipped" without AC verification

**Discovered:** 2026-05-04 (research investigation during PR #78 work)
**Category:** delivery-discipline
**Severity:** HIGH — silent data loss for downstream consumers

### Gap Description

S-3.04 (emit_event as host function refactor) was marked `status: merged` and referenced
as "shipped" in v1.0.0-beta.4. AC-001 explicitly required `emit_event()` to "route events
to the configured sinks (not just internal log)." Investigation on 2026-05-04 revealed that
the integration step at `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/sinks/mod.rs:11-15` is an
unimplemented TODO — `Router::submit` is never called from `main.rs`. Plugin events have
been silently routing to `dispatcher-internal-*.jsonl` instead of `events-*.jsonl` since
S-1.4 (April 24, 2026), invisible to every downstream consumer.

The story spec, the implementation crates (sink-core, sink-file, sink-otel-grpc, Router,
RoutingFilter) all shipped — but the integration "wire it up in main.rs" step had no AC
test enforcing it, so the gap was never caught.

### Root Cause

Story acceptance was signed off without an end-to-end verification test confirming that
AC-001 actually held. Unit tests on the individual components (sink, router) passed. There
was no bats or cargo integration test exercising the full path: dispatcher receives event
→ Router::submit called → event reaches configured sink file.

### Systemic Pattern

For "integration" ACs — those of the form "X is wired into Y" — unit testing the
components in isolation gives false confidence. Only a test that sends an event through
the running dispatcher and asserts it appears in the correct sink file would catch this
class of gap.

### Lesson

Story ship status MUST be gated on a passing AC-verification test (either bats, cargo
integration test, or equivalent), not just a story-writer signoff. For integration ACs,
the test must exercise the end-to-end path. Before an implementer marks a story complete,
every AC must be linked to a specific test name + test file path + test result. An agent
MUST refuse to mark a story complete without this artifact.

### Disposition

- **Bug fix:** In progress via E-TELEMETRY epic (wiring Router::submit in main.rs).
- **Process fix:** S-7.04 opened — "Add AC-test-link discipline to per-story-delivery flow" (see STORY-INDEX.md E-7).
- **TD-007 amendment:** Added 2026-05-04 note; original "shipped" claim corrected.
- **Reference:** `.factory/stories/S-3.04-emit-event-host-function.md`; `.factory/tech-debt-register.md` TD-007

## LESSON-2026-05-04-002 [process-gap] Dashboards query fields no plugin emits

**Discovered:** 2026-05-04 (forensic field inventory during PR #78 research)
**Category:** observability-contract
**Severity:** MEDIUM — panels permanently zero; users misled about pipeline health

### Gap Description

Multiple Grafana dashboard panels query event_type values or field names that no plugin
actually emits:

- `plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-prs.json:96`
  queries `event_type="pr.opened"` — the WASM plugin (capture-pr-activity) emits
  `pr.created`. Panel shows zero forever.
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-prs.json:335,365`
  queries `open_to_merge_seconds` on `pr.merged` events — no plugin emits this field.
  Panel is permanently unwired.
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json:616`
  also queries `pr.opened` (same mismatch as above).

The mismatch was invisible during authoring because dashboards were written against an
assumed emitter contract, with no validation gate checking whether that contract was
actually implemented.

### Root Cause

Dashboard queries form an implicit contract with emitter plugins. There is no CI lint
hook that validates: "every event_type and field referenced in a Grafana dashboard query
has a corresponding emit call in the actual plugin sources." The contract diverged and
remained undetected indefinitely.

### Emitter Sources (ground truth)

The authoritative union of emitted fields/types is derivable from:
1. WASM plugin `host::emit_event` call sites in `crates/hook-plugins/*/src/`
2. Bash hooks invoking `bin/emit-event` in `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/*.sh`
3. Dispatcher lifecycle event constants in `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/internal_log.rs`

### Lesson

Dashboard queries and emitter plugins share an implicit schema contract. That contract
needs explicit CI validation. A lint hook should (a) grep all Grafana JSON files for
`event_type=` and field references, (b) grep all plugin sources for corresponding emit
definitions, and (c) fail CI if any dashboard field has no emitter. This check should
ride TD-014 (bash-hook native WASM migration) since both workstreams require emitter
contract awareness.

### Disposition

- **S-7.05 opened** — "Add dashboard-emitter-contract lint hook" (see STORY-INDEX.md E-7).
  Target: v1.0.1. Can be delivered independently of E-TELEMETRY.
- **Reference:** `plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-prs.json`;
  `plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json`;
  TD-014 (bash-hook retirement workstream)
