| D-731 | S-18.12 LOCAL ADVERSARIAL PASS-7 CLEAN CLOSURE 2026-06-30 — pass-7 VERDICT CLEAN (0 BLOCKING / 0 HIGH / 0 MEDIUM / 0 LOW blocking); streak 0/3→1/3; severity decay H→H→M→M→CLEAN→MED→CLEAN (passes 1-7). Two non-blocking LOW observations: O-1 (LOW) AC-003 IFS step-1 anchor omitted brace-group `{ IFS=…; }` form (`\{[[:space:]]+` alternation) and case-pattern `) IFS=…` form (`[)][[:space:]]+` alternation); prospective-only gap (no real script triggers); HARDENED same-burst — test-writer 7a2b3ccf (extended step-1 anchor; positive controls brace+case forms MUST flag; negative controls `foo() {` function-def + `$(cmd)` subshell-close MUST NOT flag; real-script scan net violations = 0 zero over-match confirmed); technical-writer 5d5c3ad6 (bash-portability.md §3 regex byte-identical update); story-writer 642bbb8b (AC-003 enumeration byte-identical update; v1.7→v1.8). Final step-1 regex (byte-parity across test/doc/story verified by orchestrator): `(^|;|&&|&|[|][|]|(then|do|else|elif)[[:space:]]|\{[[:space:]]+|[)][[:space:]]+)[[:space:]]*(export[[:space:]]+|readonly[[:space:]]+|declare[[:space:]]+-g[[:space:]]+)?IFS=`. O-2 (LOW) AC-005 jq preflight whole-file (asymmetric with AC-001 positional); ACCEPTED-AS-DESIGNED — jq is categorically forbidden by wave-handoff SKILL.md; whole-file detection is adequate defense-in-depth for a prohibited dependency; positional refinement intentionally out of scope; soundness-boundary note added to bash-portability.md §3 AC-005 section (technical-writer 5d5c3ad6). Suite: AC-003 portability test GREEN; wave-handoff.bats GREEN. 2 pre-existing unrelated failures (resolver-integration timing flap; pass-real-state-md-snapshot fixture) noted as unrelated.

| D-668 | E-18 WASM-pivot human directive 2026-06-20 — Human architectural directive recorded: E-18 context-durability epic hooks MUST be implemented as native WASM hook plugins (Rust crate via hook-sdk, compiled to WASM, registered directly in hooks-registry.toml, run by the dispatcher) — NOT as bash .sh scripts wrapped by legacy-bash-adapter.wasm. Disposition: RE-SPEC TO WASM, SUPERSEDE BASH. The in-flight bash implementation of S-18.04a (precompact-flush.sh + bats, in worktree feature/S-18.04a) is SUPERSEDED. Behavioral contracts (BC-7.07.001 etc.) are preserved; only the implementation mechanism changes from bash to native WASM. Scope = the ENTIRE E-18 epic: remaining Wave-4 stories (S-18.04a, S-18.04b, S-18.03) are to be (re)built as native WASM; retroactive migration of already-merged E-18 bash hooks (S-18.00, S-18.01, S-18.02, S-18.13) is in-scope for planning — architect to scope and recommend the retroactive migration plan. Architect ADR + WASM-hook design + concrete re-spec/migration plan is IN PROGRESS (dispatched concurrently). The S-18.04a LOCAL bash cascade (BC-5.39.001) is HALTED/superseded — prior bash-oriented adversary findings (F-PF1-*, F-ADV-*) and the bash spec edits D-666/D-667 are now historical; the WASM re-spec will reset the implementation track. Autonomy directive STILL HOLDS: stop-before-PR-merge per story (D-665). STATE.md + decision-log.md updated (pivot-marker burst only; NO spec/ADR/story edits in this burst — those are handled by architect in concurrent dispatch). 4-index UNCHANGED: BC v3.24/VP v2.40/STORY v4.41/ARCH v2.60.

Production script precompact-flush.sh judged CORRECT; all findings are test-genuineness defects. Story side remediated: S-18.04a v1.6→v1.7 (story-writer: added two Red Gate Test Table rows — test_decide_append_failure_action_noreset_on_diverged for PC8 step 3b and test_reset_failure_blocks_exit_2 for PC8 step 4 canonical TV reset-failure-block; test-count note refreshed).

| D-017 | S-7.03 pass-4 — F-002 Option B (blockquote BEFORE rows) caused GFM table-rendering regression; corrected via Option C (blockquote AFTER rows). Lesson: table annotations should default to SS-08 line 1908 footer-comment pattern (HTML comment after rows), not blockquote before rows. Process-gap O-101 — codify in BC-INDEX template. | In GFM/CommonMark, a blockquote terminates a preceding table block; rows below it become a headerless fragment that renders broken. HTML comments do not terminate tables. Option C (move blockquote after rows) is markdown-native and makes "listed above" phrasing accurate. | pass-4-fix-burst | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-018 | S-7.03 pass-5 — F-201 (story References section BC path prefix `plugins/vsdd-factory/.factory/specs/...`) fixed; trajectory 25→12→5→2→1; convergence clock not yet started (pass-5 not NITPICK-only, 1 LOW finding remains). Story bumped v1.3→v1.4. | Path prefix was `plugins/vsdd-factory/.factory/specs/behavioral-contracts/...` — directory does not exist; correct prefix is `.factory/specs/behavioral-contracts/...`. Frontmatter `inputs:` was already correct; defect was in human-readable References section only. | pass-5-fix-burst | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-019 | S-7.03 pass-6 NITPICK-only achieved (0 substantive findings, 6 NITPICK obs); trajectory 25→12→5→2→1→0; convergence step 1 of 3 reached. | Pass-6 is first of 3 consecutive NITPICK-only passes required by ADR-013. Pass-7 and pass-8 must each also be NITPICK-only. No spec/story content changes needed. | adv-pass-6 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-020 | S-7.03 pass-7 NITPICK-only achieved (0 substantive, 8 NITPICK obs); convergence step 2 of 3 reached; trajectory continues monotonic decay 25→12→5→2→1→0→0. | Pass-7 is second of 3 consecutive NITPICK-only passes required by ADR-013. Pass-8 must also be NITPICK-only for CONVERGENCE_REACHED. No spec/story content changes needed. | adv-pass-7 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-021 | S-7.03 pass-8 — fresh-eyes Dimension 2 (dogfooding readiness) caught F-301 task-ref off-by-one; partial-fix-regression sweep also caught Batch A/B task-range drift. Both fixed. Convergence clock RESETS to 0 of 3. Total passes will reach 11 (vs 8 for S-6.01). | Intra-document Architecture Compliance Rules ↔ Tasks cross-reference axis was unprobed by passes 3-7. Pass-8 Dimension 2 lens exposed it. Sibling sweep caught Batch A/B stranding Task 13 in wrong batch. Both fixed atomically in v1.5 per BC-5.36.005-006 partial-fix discipline. | adv-pass-8 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-022 | S-7.03 pass-9 — fresh-context sibling sweep caught F-401 (VP-063 task-ref missed in pass-8 burst) and dogfooding-readiness lens caught F-402 (AC-011 enumeration undercount propagated to DoD/Task 19). Both are novel sub-axes prior passes did not probe. Convergence clock RESETS to 0 of 3. Total passes projected: 12 (S-6.01 was 8). | Inter-document sibling sweep stopped at story-file boundary in pass-8 fix burst; VP-063 was not swept for task-number references. Intra-document AC-vs-AC bats test count coherence was unprobed across all 9 passes. Both defects are real implementer-trap findings. | adv-pass-9 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-023 | S-7.03 pass-10 — AC-011 letter-relabel propagation gap from F-402 caused 3 sibling misses (story line 652 + BC-5.38.004 + BC-5.38.005). Pass-10 also caught Task 19 contributing-list omission (Task 17). Aggressive sweep applied; zero stale letter refs remain. Convergence clock RESETS to 0 of 3. Total passes projected: 13 (vs S-6.01's 8). | F-402 fix expanded AC-011 9→18 tests with letter relabel; fix burst propagated count words and Layer scope but did NOT propagate letter labels through cross-references. Structural enumeration changes require sweeping ALL cross-references that cite enumerated items by ordinal. | adv-pass-10 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-024 | S-7.03 pass-11 — pass-1 BC-8.30.002 SS-08→SS-05 re-anchor propagation gap surfaced after 11 passes (VP-064 scope/traceability + VP-INDEX). Aggressive PO sweep applied. Convergence clock RESETS. Total projected passes: 14 (vs S-6.01's 8). Pattern lesson: BC frontmatter subsystem changes must sweep all VPs whose bcs[] include that BC. | Root defect: pass-1 propagated BC-8.30.002 re-anchor to BC frontmatter + BC-INDEX but not to VP-064.scope or VP-064 traceability or VP-INDEX Scope column. VP frontmatter is a less-trafficked review axis; 11 passes elapsed before fresh-eyes lens probed it. | adv-pass-11 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-025 | S-7.03 pass-12 — BC→VP forward-reference asymmetry (mirror of pass-11's VP→BC reverse-direction). F-701 isolated and fixed. Comprehensive bidirectional sweep confirms zero remaining asymmetries. Trajectory monotonic decrease (3→1). Total projected passes: 15. | BC-5.38.001 incorrectly cited VP-064 as its Verification Property; VP-064.bcs[] does not include BC-5.38.001 (they are mutually exclusive: strict-mode vs facade-mode). Fixed to (static-check) pattern matching siblings. BC↔VP bidirectional sweep of all 13 BCs clean post-fix. | adv-pass-12 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-026 | S-7.03 pass-13 — exhaustive methodology (8 axis families, 30+ sub-axes). Self-validation loop withdrew 2 candidate findings (F-801 token budget, F-802 VP-INDEX arithmetic — both verified clean on re-check). Single substantive finding O-303 (story Verification note undercounts static-check BCs from 2 to actual 5). Self-withdrawal pattern is convergence signal. Total projected passes: 16. | Exhaustive axis enumeration broke the "1 novel axis per pass" pattern; found 1 LOW + 1 NITPICK + 2 self-withdrawn. Verification-note BC enumeration coherence (story body summary vs BC frontmatter verification methods) was a sub-axis adjacent to but not previously probed. O-303 fixed by expanding "BC-5.38.004 and BC-5.38.005" → "BC-5.38.001, BC-5.38.004, BC-5.38.005, BC-5.38.006, BC-8.30.001". | adv-pass-13 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-027 | S-7.03 pass-14 — exhaustive methodology surfaced 2 LOW novel findings via sub-axes E.7 (PRD per-SS count footers) and J.6 (VP harness skeleton accuracy). Trajectory 1→2 (small uptick); both genuinely novel sub-axes. Total projected: 17 passes. | PRD per-SS footer counts and VP harness skeleton accuracy were previously unprobed axes. Both findings are real and substantive despite LOW severity. Convergence clock RESETS to 0 of 3. | adv-pass-14 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-028 | [process-gap] F-901 revealed PRD is a count consumer NOT in S-7.02 validate-count-propagation.sh hook scope. PRD per-SS footers drifted by 25 BCs (SS-05 Δ=10, SS-06 Δ=14, SS-08 Δ=1). Future work: either (a) extend hook to scan PRD per-SS footer counts, or (b) replace per-SS footer counts in PRD with links to BC-INDEX (canonical source). Tracked for v1.1 hardening backlog. | Structural count-propagation gap analogous to D-024 (VP propagation gap). PRD secondary document consumers are not in hook scope. Fix burst applied minimum-diff PRD updates; root cause tracked here. | pass-14-fix-burst | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-029 | S-7.03 pass-15 NITPICK-only — first post-reset clean pass after pass-14 fixes. Trajectory 2→0 expected decay. Adversary self-validation withdrew 5 candidates (incl. PRD beta.4 milestone, capabilities CAP-028 milestone, SS-NN ARCH BC range labels) — all correctly classified as release-cycle/systemic drift not S-7.03 spec foundation. Convergence step 1 of 3. | Pass-15 exhaustive methodology, 14 axis families probed. Increased withdrawal rate (5 vs pass-13's 2) is a convergence signal. Out-of-scope drift correctly excluded. Pass-14 fix verification all clean. | adv-pass-15 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-030 | [process-gap] Out-of-scope observations from pass-15 logged for v1.1 hardening backlog (alongside D-027 PRD count-propagation hook gap): PRD §1.2 milestone references stale (beta.4→beta.6), CAP-028 outcome stale, SS-05/SS-08 architecture documents use deprecated flat BC ID scheme. None blocking S-7.03 convergence. | Release-cycle drift and systemic arch-doc ID scheme staleness are real but out of S-7.03 scope. Tracked here so v1.1 hardening can address them without reopening convergence clock. | adv-pass-15 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-031 | S-7.03 pass-16 NITPICK-only — second consecutive clean pass (after pass-15). Self-validation withdrawal rate climbed: pass-13: 2, pass-14: 2, pass-15: 5, pass-16: 11. Increasing withdrawal rate at late convergence = adversary generates more hypotheses but spec rebuts all. Ideal pattern. Convergence step 2 of 3. | Family O (12 new sub-axes) + Family P (sibling comparison) + Family Q (off-by-one) all clean. Diminishing-returns territory confirmed. Out-of-scope drift items re-confirmed but correctly excluded. Pass-17 final: if NITPICK-only → CONVERGENCE_REACHED. | adv-pass-16 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |
| D-032 | **S-7.03 SPEC CONVERGENCE_REACHED at pass-17.** ADR-013 criterion satisfied (3 NITPICK-only consecutive: pass-15 53cc837, pass-16 09b05f2, pass-17 this commit). Trajectory: 25→12→5→2→1→0→0→1→2→4→3→1→1→2→0→0→0. Total 17 passes vs S-6.01's 8 — proportional to S-7.03's 13-BC, 4-layer, multi-subsystem complexity. Spec approved for GREEN-phase TDD implementation. | 4 out-of-scope items (PRD beta.4 milestone, CAP-028 outcome, SS-05/SS-08 arch BC ID schemes, KL-002 VP count) deferred to v1.1 hardening backlog (D-028 + D-030 lineage). | adv-pass-17 | 2026-04-27 | state-manager |

(b) Cycle-closing checklist S-7.02 SATISFIED — all process-gap findings codified into engine; no deferred follow-ups required: INV-017→D-485 (narrow-vs-residual dual-grep); INV-018→D-487 (residual STRUCTURALLY BROADER); INV-019→D-489 (changelog self-reference; cures a/b/c); INV-020→D-490 (POLICY 14 → 5-leg quintuple parity); INV-020 RECURRENCE→D-494 (POLICY 14 verification_step 7 — 4-index self-application gate); INV-019 RESIDUAL→D-493 (cure (c) by-construction in persisted reports). Same-cycle codification IS the resolution; no deferred follow-ups needed. (c) Cure-extension parsimony empirically validated 3 consecutive passes (pass-9, pass-10, pass-11) — INV-021 abstraction definitively unwarranted; existing cure set (INV-019 cure (c) + POLICY 14 5-leg + verification_step 7 literal-shell gate) sufficient for convergence and forward-applicable to all state-manager codification bursts. (d) Cumulative metrics: 11 cascade passes; 2 PO fix-bursts (passes 1 + 5 each closing critical/high findings); 8 state-manager codification bursts (D-487..D-496); META-LEVEL evolution INV-017→INV-018→INV-019→INV-020→POLICY 14 5-leg+gate; CRITICAL=0 sustained 10 passes; HIGH=0 sustained 3 passes. (e) Unblocks 3M3b story elaboration for 5 M3 stories (S-15.10, S-15.12, S-15.13, S-15.15, S-15.16-Part-B) — these stories implement BC-5.39.007 (validate-closes-completeness) and BC-5.39.008 (validate-policies-schema) hooks now adversary-converged; story-writer dispatch ready. MM gate INVOKED: global max D-496 confirmed (brownfield D-496; F5 D-454); D-497 confirmed next-available.

D-497 codified (5 sub-clauses): 3M3a-r 3-CLEAN convergence declared per BC-5.39.001; cycle-closing checklist S-7.02 satisfied (all process-gap findings INV-017..020+RECURRENCE codified into engine via POLICY 14 extensions); cure-extension parsimony validated 3 consecutive passes; cumulative 11 passes + 2 PO + 8 state-manager bursts; unblocks 3M3b story elaboration.

(b) STREAK 1/3 → 2/3 SECOND ADVANCE per BC-5.39.001 — CLEAN advances streak; one more CLEAN/NITPICK pass for 3-CLEAN convergence at projected D-497; 3-CLEAN convergence unblocks 3M3b story elaboration for S-15.10/12/13/15/16-Part-B. (c) Cure-extension parsimony VALIDATED 2 consecutive passes — pass-9 confirmed no INV-021 needed; pass-10 ALSO confirms no new abstraction needed; INV-020 RECURRENCE + POLICY 14 extension cure is sufficient; parsimony principle validated empirically across 2 codification bursts (pass-9 + pass-10). (d) D-495 codification artifacts adversary-verified clean — no defects introduced; adv-bc-007-008-pass-9.md persisted correctly (CLEAN, streak "1/3", cure (c) by-construction); 4-index bumps synchronized D-001..D-495; 5-leg parity verified; burst-log D-495 h2 all 8 D-444(c) blocks; decision-log D-495 row + STATE.md D-495 row + L-M3-BC-cascade-pass-9 lesson all factually accurate; POLICY 14 extended_at: D-494 + verification_step 7 literal-shell template present.

(c) D-494 POLICY 14 extension empirically validated — adversary independently executed 4-index self-application gate at pass-9 review; all 4 indexes PASS leg-4 sync (BC v2.46, VP v2.03, STORY v3.50, ARCH v2.12); F-BC008P8-001 closure confirmed sustained; cure operational; no regression detected. (d) Cure-extension parsimony confirmed — pass-8 potential INV-021-CANDIDATE was correctly absorbed as INV-020 RECURRENCE with POLICY 14 extension; pass-9 confirms NO new INV-N abstraction needed; cure-extension parsimony validated empirically.

Adversary pass-8 report: cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-bc-007-008-pass-8.md. (a) Adversary pass-8 persisted: verdict HIGH; 1 finding (F-BC008P8-001 HIGH — BC-INDEX v2.45 leg-4 (last_amended text-prefix) stale; cites v2.44 while version:=2.45; POLICY 14 / INV-020 RECURRENCE; D-493 codification burst updated BC-INDEX leg-1+leg-2 but missed leg-4; 3 of 4 indexes correctly synced; only BC-INDEX singleton missed); CRIT=0 sustained 7 passes; HIGH=1 RECURRENCE; cascade trajectory 41→14→8→3→5→2 NIT→1 NIT→1 HIGH. Fix: BC-INDEX v2.45→v2.46 with proper 5-leg parity (all legs including leg-4 synced this burst); INV-020 RECURRENCE acknowledged; NO new INV class — same cure class as INV-020 (POLICY 14 5-leg parity).

## D-1057 — D-1057-S2111-SIZING-OVERRIDE-AND-DECOMPOSITION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1056`. This entry is D-1057, the next decision allocated after D-1056. The
pre-existing `decision-log.md D-1011/D-1012 + D-1016..D-1052 (exhaustive)` per-decision backfill
obligation (STATE.md Blocking Issues) is unrelated to this entry and remains carried forward
unchanged; this entry does not attempt that backfill.

**Scope note (single-commit registration + decomposition burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053).**
At the HUMAN CONVERGENCE + SIZING-DECISION gate presented at D-1056 (§3 of the Session Resume
Checkpoint), the operator **OVERRODE the standing keep-unified sizing decision** — S-21.11 (32
pts, converged v2.11, BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN as of D-1056) is **SPLIT** into six sub-stories, taken
**AFTER** the story reached full 3-CLEAN convergence (D-1056), not before — the split decomposes
an already-converged, stable spec bundle rather than an in-flux one.

**(a) Sizing override.** The standing decision recorded at D-1040 and re-surfaced at every pass
since (most recently D-1056 §4, "Keep S-21.11 as ONE unified story remains the standing human
decision; do NOT split it without explicit human direction") was **keep-unified**. At the D-1056
gate, the operator explicitly directed a split, superseding that standing decision. This is a
human-directed sizing override, not an AI-initiated deferral — Canonical Principle Rule 3's
human-direction requirement is satisfied.

**(b) Decomposition — six sub-stories from the converged v2.11 body.** Architect authored the
DAG-node seam boundaries and story-writer implemented them into six sub-story spec files, per
`.factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md`:

- **S-21.19** — Executor decision-function core (3-arg `failure_policy` extension +
  axes-independence; ADR-039 Phase 4a; split seam 1 of 6). Owns AC-001, AC-002-006, AC-009-012,
  AC-013b unit leg. 9 pts. Wave 6, `depends_on [S-21.10]`. Conceptual heart of the split — gates
  all four parallel downstream seams and transitively S-21.24.
- **S-21.20** — PC13 full-registry coverage (`on_error=Block` fail-closed across all 18 registry
  entries; BC-1.03.017 v1.18 Invariant 11; split seam 2 of 6). Owns AC-024-041 (18 ACs). 3 pts.
  Wave 7, `depends_on [S-21.19]`. Cleanest/most self-contained seam.
- **S-21.21** — AMD-002 `legacy-bash-adapter` runtime-timeout wiring fix + bifurcated bash-adapter
  calibration (ADR-039 Phase 3b+3c; split seam 3 of 6). Owns the AC-007 bash-adapter leg, AC-013,
  AC-013b e2e leg, AC-013c. 9 pts. Wave 7, `depends_on [S-21.10, S-21.19]`. Widest blast radius —
  affects all 37 `legacy-bash-adapter.wasm`-routed registry entries.
- **S-21.22** — Native-WASM fuel-axis calibration and fail-closed flip for
  `validate-cross-site-correspondence` (ADR-039 Phase 3a+4d; split seam 4 of 6). Owns the AC-007
  native-WASM leg and AC-008 in full. 4 pts. Wave 7, `depends_on [S-21.10, S-21.19]`. Owns and
  executes its own flip commit (Task #26), independent of the bash-adapter and break-glass seams.
- **S-21.23** — Break-glass override mechanism (`VSDD_BREAK_GLASS_GATE_BYPASS` for self-locking
  `PreToolUse` `^Agent$` gates; ADR-039 Phase 4b; split seam 5 of 6). Owns AC-014-023 (10 ACs, all
  of BC-1.03.018 PC1-PC10). 7 pts. Wave 7, `depends_on [S-21.10, S-21.19]`. Cleanest BC boundary —
  entirely BC-1.03.018's own sibling BC.
- **S-21.24** — Validator exhaustion fail-closed capstone: gated flip completion + full regression
  + CHANGELOG (ADR-039 Phase 4c completion + Phase 5; split seam 6 of 6, STRICTLY LAST). Owns zero
  ACs exclusively — confirms AC-009/AC-012 (S-21.19) and AC-022 (S-21.23) reach final GREEN/
  LIVE-TREE state. 3 pts. Wave 8, `depends_on [S-21.19, S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23]`. The
  DAG's Phase 5 convergence point.

AC partition: the 41 numbered ACs of S-21.11 v2.11 plus the AC-013b/AC-013c legs = **43/43**,
zero drops, zero duplicates, verified per the decomposition plan's §3 partition table.

**(c) New independent story — S-21.25 (previously-orphaned ADR-039 §Decision 5 Mitigation 1).**
S-21.25 (Fuel-headroom WARN event; 5 pts; `depends_on []`, wave 6, parallel/independent track —
no dependency edge to the S-21.19..S-21.24 `failure_policy` seams) is a **genuinely new** story,
not a seventh split seam of S-21.11 — it owns the >90% fuel-consumption early-warning signal from
ADR-039 §Decision 5 Mitigation 1, which had no owning story prior to this burst. Governed by new
**BC-1.03.019 v1.0** (product-owner; SS-01 shard; CAP-011; PC1-PC10).

**(d) DAG verified acyclic.** `S-21.10 -> S-21.19 -> {S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23} ->
S-21.24`; `S-21.25` has no incoming or outgoing edges to any other E-21 node. Waves 6 -> 7 -> 8,
replacing S-21.11's retired 32-pt W6 delivery slot with 35 pts across the six seams (S-21.25's 5
pts is additive, not a replacement — 40 pts total for the 7 new stories). STORY-INDEX's E-21
delivery blockquote and DAG wave-schedule intro blockquote both updated to reflect the split
(the `> **D-1057 S-21.11 split sub-schedule` blockquote is the authoritative post-split schedule;
the pre-split `> DAG wave schedule (8 waves...)` blockquote's W6 slot is annotated
**SUPERSEDED D-1057, see below**, not deleted — POLICY 1 append-only).

**(e) S-21.11 disposition — SUPERSEDED, POLICY 1 append-only.** `status: draft` ->
`status: superseded`; new `superseded_by: [S-21.19, S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23, S-21.24]`
frontmatter field. The v2.11 body (all 41 ACs + AC-013b/AC-013c, all Tasks, the DAG, Edge Cases,
and every other section) is **FROZEN as the historical source-of-truth** the six sub-stories
decompose from — no AC text, BC trace, task ordering, or test predicate in the body was altered,
weakened, or reinterpreted by this burst. The S-21.11 ID remains permanently allocated per
POLICY 1 — never reused, deleted, or blanked. `input-hash` recomputed `97029a5` -> `c694c6b` to
reconcile the operator-authoritative-binary drift the v2.5/v2.9 bursts flagged as owed to
state-manager; no declared `inputs:` file content was edited this burst — the drift was
pre-existing.

**(f) Index registration.** BC-INDEX v4.82 -> **v4.83**: new BC-1.03.019 v1.0 row registered
(`total_bcs` 1986 -> **1987**); BC-1.03.017 Stories cell swept `S-21.10, S-21.11` ->
`S-21.10, S-21.19, S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23, S-21.24`; BC-1.03.018 Stories cell swept
`S-21.11` -> `S-21.23`. BC-1.03.017/BC-1.03.018 input-hash reconciled (`dec3278` / `2663f9b`
respectively) via the operator-authoritative rc.23 `compute-input-hash --update`; no BC body
content altered — index-row registration + cross-reference sweep only. ARCH-INDEX v3.73 ->
**v3.74**: ADR-039 v1.14 row updated. STORY-INDEX v4.371 -> **v4.372**: S-21.11 row updated
(status/superseded_by/input-hash/frozen-body annotation); seven new rows (S-21.19..S-21.25)
registered; E-21 delivery blockquote + DAG wave-schedule intro blockquote both updated per (d).
All 11 new/modified files' `input-hash` values independently re-confirmed via the
operator-authoritative rc.23 `compute-input-hash --check` binary (exit 0 for all): S-21.11
`c694c6b`; BC-1.03.017 `dec3278`; BC-1.03.018 `2663f9b`; S-21.19 `a2dca8e`; S-21.20 `cbbc8dd`;
S-21.21 `c694c6b`; S-21.22 `a2dca8e`; S-21.23 `cbbc8dd`; S-21.24 `cbbc8dd`; S-21.25 `775050b`;
BC-1.03.019 `57262cf`.

**(g) ADR-039 v1.13 -> v1.14 (architect, subsystems sweep, audit finding 1.3).** The `subsystems_
affected` field was swept to reflect AMD-002's actual blast radius (all 37 `legacy-bash-adapter.
wasm`-routed registry entries, surfaced by the decomposition plan's S-21.21 seam analysis) — a
scope-correctness finding from the architect's fresh decomposition audit, not a new decision.
ADR-042 added to S-21.19/S-21.22 inputs per the audit's finding 1.4 (both seams' fuel-axis work
is governed by ADR-042's 20M fuel-budget raise). ADR-039 status remains `ratified`.

**(h) Owed carry-forward — NOT this burst.** Two depends_on redirects are anchored to a future
story-writer touch per the decomposition plan §4, deliberately NOT performed this burst (scope
discipline — the dispatch explicitly excluded touching S-21.13/S-21.16 bodies):

- S-21.13 `depends_on [S-21.10, S-21.11]` -> `[S-21.10, S-21.22]` (S-21.13's read_file_range/
  BC-INDEX-sidecar work targets `validate-cross-site-correspondence`, which S-21.22 now owns).
- S-21.16 `depends_on [S-21.11]` -> `[S-21.24]` (S-21.16's CI-lint hardening logically gates on
  the capstone's completed flip, not the now-superseded unified story).

Both redirects are recorded as STORY-INDEX row annotations (`**[D-1057 carry-forward] ... OWED,
NOT this burst**`) at the citing rows (S-21.16's own row, and S-21.22's `blocks:` note) so the
obligation is anchored and cannot be lost. Also owed and explicitly out of this burst's scope:
VP-authoring for BC-1.03.017/BC-1.03.018/BC-1.03.019 (Phase-6 formal-verifier, POLICY 9
sanctioned VP-TBD deferral convention); hooks-registry.toml header plugin-count 35->37 (next
maintenance sweep); `artifact-path-registry.yaml` develop-side edit (a follow-up develop-branch
PR, not a `.factory/` artifact); the 7 S-21.11 cosmetic ADVISORY/LOW nits from the D-1056
convergence-close sweep are **RESOLVED-BY-SUPERSESSION** — the sub-stories were authored clean
against the frozen v2.11 body, so the deferred cosmetic sweep against S-21.11 itself is now moot
(S-21.11 is frozen/historical, not a live editing target).

**(i) No new standing rule this burst.** This is a human-directed sizing override + mechanical
decomposition-registration burst, not an adversarial-finding remediation — no new [process-gap]
or META-LEVEL class surfaces. The existing D-1044(g)/D-1045(h)/D-1046(h)/D-1047(h)/D-1051(j)/
D-1053(i) lessons remain logged, unchanged, carried forward; they apply to the seven new stories'
OWN future pre-TDD adversarial cascades exactly as they applied to S-21.11's.

**(j) Backfill obligations, unchanged.** The pre-existing `decision-log.md D-1011/D-1012 +
D-1016..D-1042 (exhaustive)` per-decision backfill remains OWED, anchored to a future dedicated
backfill burst; not attempted this burst. The `session-checkpoints.md` D-1043/D-1044/D-1045/
D-1050/D-1051 checkpoint-archival gap also remains OWED, carried forward unchanged. This burst
archives D-1056's Session Resume Checkpoint to `session-checkpoints.md` (closing that leg for
D-1056; the pre-existing D-1043/D-1044/D-1045/D-1050/D-1051 gap, and the D-1055 full-text gap
noted below, remain OWED). **New observation this burst (not remediated, recorded for
transparency):** D-1056(j)'s claim that "this burst archives D-1055's Session Resume Checkpoint
... together with D-1054's" is only half true — `session-checkpoints.md` contains D-1054's full
checkpoint text but only a one-line "superseded by D-1055" pointer for D-1055 itself, not
D-1055's full checkpoint body. This is a pre-existing gap (D-1056's own claim, not this burst's),
out of this burst's explicit scope (registration + decomposition only); folded into the existing
OWED checkpoint-archival backfill row rather than fixed ad hoc.

**(k) Each of the seven new stories requires its own pre-TDD adversarial convergence.** Per
Canonical Principle Rule 3, splitting a converged spec does not inherit convergence for the
split parts — S-21.19, S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23, S-21.24, and S-21.25 each require
their own independent BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD
entry, starting with Wave 6 (S-21.19 + S-21.25, parallel — no dependency edge between them).

## D-1058 — D-1058-S2119-PASS1-REMEDIATION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1057`. This entry is D-1058, the next decision allocated after D-1057.

**Scope note (single-commit remediation burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053).** Per D-1057(k), each
of the six D-1057 split seams requires its own independent BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD
adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD entry, starting with Wave 6 (S-21.19 + S-21.25, parallel).
This entry records S-21.19's pass-1 outcome and its same-burst remediation.

**(a) S-21.19 pre-TDD adversary pass-1 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 1 BLOCKER finding,
**F-S2119-P1-001**: the D-1057 6-seam split of CONVERGED S-21.11 v2.11 severs an
atomicity-critical unit. As authored (S-21.19 v1.0), Task 5 wires the extended 3-arg
`plugin_fail_closed` function directly into `execute_tiers`/`execute_tier`'s real block-decision
call site at wave 6, while the five `on_error=block` plugins that must be annotated first are
owned by downstream seams landing at waves 7-8 (S-21.21/S-21.23/S-21.24). This creates a
merged-`develop` state — spanning every commit between S-21.19's merge and S-21.24's merge —
in which enforcement is active AND all five targeted plugins remain unannotated: a live CWE-636
fail-open window, directly contradicting BC-1.03.017 v1.18 Invariant 7 and PC8/PC11's mechanical
un-mergeability guarantee. S-21.19 v1.0's own Task 5 "ATOMICITY GATE" note claimed this hazard
was "vacuously satisfied" by the split; that claim was independently FALSE — vacuous
satisfaction requires the wiring to never exist without the annotations already present, and the
split as authored inverts that ordering. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.19-local-pass-1.md`.

**(b) Resolution — architect ADR-044 (capstone-owned enforcement flip).** Routed to
`vsdd-factory:architect` per the Agent Routing Table (cross-story architecture defect, not a
story-writer-fixable local gap). Architect authored **ADR-044** ("Split-topology flip-sequencing
— the enforcement-active wiring commit is capstone-owned, not core-decision-story-owned, when an
atomicity-critical story is partitioned across independently-mergeable sub-stories"; extends
ADR-039 §Decision 3; RATIFIED 2026-08-20; `subsystems_affected: [SS-01]`). The ruling: the
enforcement-active wiring commit is owned by the LAST-landing story in the split (S-21.24), not
by the story authoring the underlying decision-function logic (S-21.19). S-21.19 authors and
unit-tests the 3-arg `plugin_fail_closed` extension and `PluginOutcome.failure_policy` field as a
standalone, never-wired-into-`execute_tiers`/`execute_tier` pure function within this story;
S-21.24's new Task 0 performs the actual wiring, strictly after all five plugins are already
annotated (S-21.24 `depends_on` all five sibling seams by construction, so it cannot land first).
This makes "annotate before flip" hold by wave-schedule construction alone — no same-commit
choreography required, and no commit in `develop`'s merged history can ever observe
"enforcement-active AND any of the five plugins unannotated."

**(c) Downstream story-writer application (same burst).** Per ADR-044's per-story change-list
(`.factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md` §8.4, added this burst as §8):
- **S-21.19** v1.0→v1.1 (points 9→7, input-hash `a2dca8e`→`e6f82f2`). Task 5 sheds the
  live-wiring clause and the false "vacuously satisfied" note, retaining only the dormant 3-arg
  extension + `failure_policy` field. AC-002 and AC-011 SPLIT: unit legs retained, bats/TC-12
  integration legs relocated to S-21.24.
- **S-21.24** v1.0→v1.1 (points 3→5, input-hash `cbbc8dd`→`e3c75a4`). New Task 0 wires the
  executor enforcement-active flip strictly after the five-plugin annotation tasks; receives
  AC-002 (bats leg) and AC-011 (TC-12 leg) as new owned ACs via new Tasks 3-4.
- Combined S-21.19+S-21.24 point total unchanged at 12 (7+5) — a redistribution, not a scope
  increase. Zero `depends_on`/`blocks`/wave-assignment change (topology-preserving per plan
  §8.3). AC partition remains **43/43** — a leg-ownership move (AC-002/AC-011 integration legs
  S-21.19→S-21.24), not an AC add or drop.

**(d) State-manager registration (this burst).** ARCH-INDEX v3.74→v3.75 (new ADR-044 row,
ratified, extends ADR-039 §Decision 3). STORY-INDEX v4.372→v4.373 (S-21.19 row: 9pts/`a2dca8e`/
v1.0 → 7pts/`e6f82f2`/v1.1; S-21.24 row: 3pts/`cbbc8dd`/v1.0 → 5pts/`e3c75a4`/v1.1). Both
input-hashes independently re-verified via `compute-input-hash` against the current story files
(exit 0, no drift). New `adv-s21.19-local-pass-1.md` persisted (verbatim Part A/B + Summary +
Novelty Assessment sections per `adversarial-review-template.md`). INDEX.md: new
`## S-21.19 LOCAL Adversary Reviews` section (pass-1 row + Convergence Status: streak 0/3,
pass-2 next) plus a closing note on the now-superseded S-21.11 v2 cascade section (28 passes,
closed at split, no further passes against the frozen v2.11 body).

**(e) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: resolving a BLOCKER does not itself advance the streak —
S-21.19 LOCAL cascade streak remains **0/3**. Fresh-context adversary pass-2 against the v1.1
bundle (S-21.19 v1.1 + S-21.24 v1.1 + ADR-044 v1.0) is the next action. S-21.25's independent
pass-1 (parallel Wave 6 seam per D-1057(k)) is tracked separately and is **NOT** touched by this
entry — its own remediation burst is D-1059, scoped independently.

**(f) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst registers/reconciles/records only. It does NOT
author story or ADR body content (architect wrote ADR-044; story-writer wrote the S-21.19/S-21.24
diffs — both already present in the worktree at burst start). It does NOT touch S-21.25,
BC-1.03.019, BC-3.08.001, ADR-039, `capabilities.md`, or VP-079 — those five files remain
uncommitted in the worktree, reserved for the separate D-1059 burst (S-21.25 close).

## D-1059 — D-1059-S2125-PASS1-REMEDIATION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1058`. This entry is D-1059, the next decision allocated after D-1058.

**Scope note (single-commit remediation burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053).** Per D-1057(k), each
of the six D-1057 split seams requires its own independent BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD
adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD entry. S-21.25 is Wave 6's parallel/independent seam
(fuel-headroom WARN event, ADR-039 §Decision 5 Mitigation 1 — no dependency edges to the
S-21.19-S-21.24 `failure_policy` seams). This entry records S-21.25's pass-1 outcome and its
same-burst remediation, and also reconciles the STATE.md body sections D-1058 disclosed-deferred
(correctness-over-completeness; D-1058 chose to defer rather than risk STATE.md corruption).

**(a) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-1 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 2 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM + 3 LOW findings,
no BLOCKER. **F-S2125-P1-001** (HIGH): AC-005's regression guard specified an impossible literal
occurrence-count scan (`emit_fuel_headroom_warning(`) that cannot discriminate "one call site"
from refactor-legal restructurings, and cannot verify PC5's multi-branch-uniformity guarantee.
**F-S2125-P1-002** (HIGH): the threshold predicate (PC1: `fuel_consumed > 0.9 × fuel_cap`) and
`headroom_ratio` formula (PC7) were left inline inside the effectful post-invocation match arm
with no pure-function extraction, making them untestable in isolation. **F-S2125-P1-003**
(MEDIUM): BC-1.03.019 PC6's required-fields enumeration omitted `timestamp` — a field every
sibling `plugin.*` emitter already carries (S-19.09 T-013/F-WG-003 precedent) — and Event 7 was
unregistered in BC-3.08.001's SS-03 catalog. **F-S2125-P1-004** (MEDIUM): BC-1.03.019 v1.0's
Changelog row narrated `input-hash: "PENDING"` while the frontmatter already carried a real
computed value (`57262cf`); separately, S-21.25's own input-hash goes stale the instant
BC-1.03.019 is amended. **F-S2125-P1-005** (LOW): PC6's "exactly these fields" wording falsely
excluded `message`, contradicting PC8. **F-S2125-P1-006** (LOW): ADR-039 §Decision 5 Mitigation
1's WARN message read "...≥90% of budget..." while its own trigger predicate is strict
(`fuel_consumed > 0.9 × cap`) — exactly 90% does not fire, per BC-1.03.019 PC2's boundary control;
the message misdescribed its own trigger. **F-S2125-P1-007** (LOW, pre-existing but load-bearing):
`capabilities.md` CAP-011 body still cited "default 10M operations," stale against ADR-042
§Decision 2's 10M→20M raise; BC-1.03.019 anchors to CAP-011, making the staleness load-bearing
for this story. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-1.md`.

**(b) Resolution — all 7 findings fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral.**
- `vsdd-factory:story-writer` (S-21.25 v1.0→v1.1, input-hash `775050b`→`558a5a3`): extracted named
  pure helpers `fuel_headroom_exceeded`/`fuel_headroom_ratio` + a thin
  `check_and_emit_fuel_headroom_warning` orchestration shell (closes F-S2125-P1-002); redesigned
  AC-005 around a `// SINGLE-EMIT-SITE` marker-scan, satisfiable and refactor-tolerant (closes
  F-S2125-P1-001); AC-006 field enumeration corrected (+`message`/`timestamp`, closes
  F-S2125-P1-005); AC-008 message string corrected to strict `>90%` (cascade of F-S2125-P1-006);
  BC-1.03.019 v1.0→v1.1 and ADR-039 v1.14→v1.15 re-anchor swept throughout.
- `vsdd-factory:product-owner` (BC-1.03.019 v1.0→v1.1, input-hash `57262cf`→`7368f5a`;
  BC-3.08.001 v1.24→v1.25, input-hash `35c30eb`→`fe4436a`): PC6 field set corrected (+`timestamp`
  with S-19.09 sibling-parity cross-reference, closes F-S2125-P1-003 in part); PC6
  false-exclusivity wording corrected (closes F-S2125-P1-005); PC8 message string corrected to
  strict `>90%` (cascade of F-S2125-P1-006); BC-3.08.001 Event 7 `plugin.fuel_headroom_warning`
  registered in the SS-03 catalog, H1 title updated, six→seven count-phrase sweep (closes
  F-S2125-P1-003 in full); BC-1.03.019 v1.0 Changelog row "PENDING" narrative corrected in place
  to the actual `57262cf` value (closes F-S2125-P1-004 narrative half).
- `vsdd-factory:architect` (ADR-039 v1.14→v1.15; `capabilities.md` v1.11→v1.12, input-hash
  `c54ab65`; VP-079 v1.19→v1.20, input-hash `704a8ca`): §Decision 5 Mitigation 1 WARN message
  corrected `≥90%`→`>90%` via non-re-ratifying **§Erratum E-006** — same non-decision-content
  category as E-001..E-005, no POLICY 22 re-ratification required since the 0.9× threshold itself
  is unchanged (closes F-S2125-P1-006); CAP-011 body corrected "default 10M operations"→"default
  20M operations (per ADR-042 §Decision 2)" (closes F-S2125-P1-007); VP-079 amended under POLICY 9
  propagation — Mandatory-Fields table row + SITE_7 added to Property 6, with an explicit scope
  note that SITE_7 is schema-catalogued only and NOT yet mutation-proven (fixture pending S-21.25
  delivery; Event 7's triggering-condition/semantics properties remain out of VP-079's scope,
  owed to a forthcoming BC-1.03.019-anchored VP-TBD). Architect independently verified
  verification-architecture.md and verification-coverage-matrix.md require no per-event edit
  (VP-079's row in both is a bare stable anchor, POLICY 9 grep-confirmed).
- `vsdd-factory:state-manager` (this burst): input-hash reconciliation via the per-file operator
  `compute-input-hash` binary (POLICY 18; never dev-source `--scan --update` per D-952), run in
  dependency order to avoid cascade drift — `capabilities.md` (`3033e89`→`c54ab65`, drifted from
  an ARCH-INDEX change that landed after architect computed the hash) → BC-1.03.019
  (`57262cf`→`7368f5a`) → BC-3.08.001 (`35c30eb`→`fe4436a`) → VP-079 (`ffa54ae`→`704a8ca`,
  drifted from the BC-3.08.001 update) → S-21.25 (`775050b`→`558a5a3`); all five re-verified
  clean (`--check` exit 0) after the full chain settled (closes F-S2125-P1-004 hash half). New
  `adv-s21.25-local-pass-1.md` persisted (Part A/B + Disposition + Summary + Novelty Assessment
  sections). 4-index propagation (BC-INDEX/ARCH-INDEX/VP-INDEX/STORY-INDEX).

**(c) STATE.md body reconciliation (D-1058-deferred sections, closed this burst).** D-1058
disclose-deferred a full STATE.md body reconcile rather than risk the duplicated-section
corruption it hit mid-edit — correctness over completeness. This burst brings the deferred
sections current for BOTH D-1058 and D-1059: Decisions Log body table (D-1058 + D-1059 rows
added), Story Status (S-21.19 v1.1/7pts, S-21.24 v1.1/5pts, S-21.25 v1.1, all 7 sub-stories
reflected in per-story convergence), Identifier Conventions (ADR count +ADR-044), Concurrent
Cycles, Session Resume Checkpoint (next action: adversary pass-2 for S-21.19 AND S-21.25),
Phase Progress, Blocking Issues, trajectory-tail LENGTH=4, banner `wc -l`. Small, single-section
edits used throughout per the CRITICAL editing discipline that caused D-1058's original
corruption risk; each edit structurally verified before the next.

**(d) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: resolving findings does not itself advance the streak —
S-21.25 LOCAL cascade streak remains **0/3**. Fresh-context adversary pass-2 against the v1.1
bundle (S-21.25 v1.1 + BC-1.03.019 v1.1 + BC-3.08.001 v1.25 + ADR-039 v1.15 + VP-079 v1.20 +
`capabilities.md` v1.12) is the next action.

**(e) Drift item (recorded, not silently left bare).** BC-1.03.019's `VP-TBD` placeholder remains
open — a REAL triggering-condition VP (threshold predicate, boundary controls, `headroom_ratio`
formula, independence from `on_error`/`failure_policy`) is still owed; VP-079 covers only the
Event 7 wire-shape/schema-conformance dimension, not the `>90%` semantics. Anchored to a
Phase-6 formal-verifier / named VP-authoring pass follow-up — not this burst's scope.

**(f) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst registers/reconciles/records only for the five
S-21.25-cluster files (already authored in the worktree at burst start by story-writer/
product-owner/architect) plus the STATE.md body reconcile explicitly assigned to D-1059. It does
NOT touch S-21.19, S-21.24, or ADR-044 — those were D-1058's scope and are unchanged here.

## D-1060 — D-1060-WAVE6-PASS2-REMEDIATION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1059`. This entry is D-1060, the next decision allocated after D-1059.

**Scope note (single-commit remediation burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053; atomic across BOTH
S-21.19 and S-21.25 clusters).** Per D-1057(k), each split seam requires its own independent
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD entry. This entry records
pass-2 outcomes for BOTH the S-21.19 cluster (D-1058's remediated bundle) and the S-21.25 cluster
(D-1059's remediated bundle), and their same-burst remediations, as one atomic Wave-6 burst.

**(a) S-21.19 pre-TDD adversary pass-2 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 2 MEDIUM findings, no BLOCKER/HIGH.
Pass-1's BLOCKER F-S2119-P1-001 (ADR-044 capstone-owned flip) independently re-verified FIXED —
not reopened. **F-S2119-P2-001** (MEDIUM): BC-1.03.017 v1.18 Invariant 7's atomicity policy
literally contradicted ADR-044's own declared-safe compliant state — Invariant 7's "contains the
extended function" trigger conflated authoring (S-21.19, inert) with wiring (S-21.24 Task 0,
enforcement-active), tripping on S-21.19's OWN compliant merge; PC11 had already been corrected to
the wiring-keyed form (v1.3-v1.5) but Invariant 7 was an un-swept sibling site. **F-S2119-P2-002**
(MEDIUM): AC-009's enforcement-behavior assertion cannot be simultaneously red-first-authored and
green-on-`develop` at S-21.19's own merge point, because the behavior it asserts genuinely does
not exist until S-21.24's deferred Task 0 flip (wave 8) — a structural red-first/green-trunk
conflict introduced by ADR-044's own (correct) deferred-flip topology. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.19-local-pass-2.md`.

**(b) S-21.19 resolution — both findings fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral.**
- `vsdd-factory:product-owner` (BC-1.03.017 v1.18→v1.19, input-hash `dec3278`→`86a7e19`): rewrote
  Invariant 7 to key the CWE-636 regression trigger on the function being WIRED INTO / IN EFFECT
  in the block-decision chain (enforcement-active per PC11's static-scan signal), explicitly
  disambiguating authoring (3-arg function + `PluginOutcome.failure_policy` population — inert,
  S-21.19, NOT the flip, NOT prohibited) from wiring (the `execute_tiers`/`execute_tier` 2-arg→
  3-arg call-site replacement — the enforcement-active flip, S-21.24 Task 0); added ADR-044 to
  `inputs:` and the Traceability ADR row (new citation naming S-21.19 as authoring leg and S-21.24
  as wiring leg); verified consistency with PC11 (same wiring/enforcement-active signal), ADR-044
  (same authoring-vs-wiring split), and PC5/PC10/Invariant 1's pre-existing axes-independence
  (untouched). PC11 itself unchanged (closes F-S2119-P2-001).
- `vsdd-factory:story-writer` (S-21.19 v1.1→v1.2, input-hash `e6f82f2` unchanged; S-21.24
  v1.1→v1.2, input-hash `e3c75a4` unchanged): S-21.19 AC-009 marked
  `#[ignore = "enforcement gate; enabled at S-21.24 Task 0 flip"]`, with a compile-safe
  fs-source-scan cross-assertion added that verifies the dormant extension/field exist and are NOT
  yet referenced at the real block-decision call site — giving AC-009 real assertion content at
  S-21.19's own merge point without red-trunk violation or premature wiring; S-21.24 Task 5 gained
  the matching un-ignore step that removes the gate once its own Task 0 performs the wiring (closes
  F-S2119-P2-002). Both stories re-anchored to BC-1.03.017 v1.18→v1.19. Zero points/depends_on/
  blocks/wave change on either story.

**(c) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-2 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 1 HIGH + 2 MEDIUM findings, no
BLOCKER. Pass-1's F-S2125-P1-001/002 independently re-verified FIXED as designed (named pure
helpers + SINGLE-EMIT-SITE marker-scan guard both present) — not reopened; reviewing the fix's own
placement surfaced a fresh, distinct defect (below). **F-S2125-P2-001** (HIGH): the AC-005
SINGLE-EMIT-SITE marker-scan guard was co-located in the same source file as the call site it
scans, so the scan matched the test's own source (containing a textual reference to the marker
string) in addition to the production call site — recurring the self-match failure class
F-S2125-P1-001 was written to close, via a different mechanism (co-location, not literal-count
semantics); this also produced a RED/GREEN inversion (the guard passes even when the real call
site is mutated away, giving zero regression protection). **F-S2125-P2-002** (MEDIUM): the emitter
function name `emit_fuel_headroom_warning` omitted the `plugin_` qualifier carried by both
BC-3.08.001's Event 7 wire name (`plugin.fuel_headroom_warning`, registered v1.25) and sibling
emitters' naming convention. **F-S2125-P2-003** (MEDIUM): BC-3.08.001 v1.25 carried a stale
VP-079-staleness flag at 3 sites (§VP Anchors bullet, Amendment changes-made item 11, standalone
Amendment paragraph) — VP-079 v1.20 already registered Event 7 in a prior burst, the flagged
architect follow-up was already done, the flag was simply never cleared. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-2.md`.

**(d) S-21.25 resolution — all 3 findings fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral.**
- `vsdd-factory:story-writer` (S-21.25 v1.1→v1.2, input-hash `558a5a3`→`4af3ec2`): relocated the
  AC-005 regression guard to a dedicated file under `tests/` (outside the source tree it scans)
  with a `concat!`-built needle (`concat!("check_and_emit_", "plugin_fuel_headroom_warning")`-class
  construction) so the needle never appears as literal source text the scan could self-match
  against; RED/GREEN correctness re-verified (mutation-removal of the real call site now correctly
  fails the test) (closes F-S2125-P2-001). Emitter renamed
  `emit_fuel_headroom_warning`→`emit_plugin_fuel_headroom_warning` throughout the story body
  (contributes to closing F-S2125-P2-002).
- `vsdd-factory:product-owner` (BC-1.03.019 v1.1→v1.2, input-hash `7368f5a` unchanged; BC-3.08.001
  v1.24→v1.25→v1.26, input-hash `fe4436a`→`9cc52d3`): swept the `emit_fuel_headroom_warning`→
  `emit_plugin_fuel_headroom_warning` rename into both BCs' Amendment sections (closes
  F-S2125-P2-002 in full). Closed the false VP-079-staleness flag at all 3 BC-3.08.001 sites — VP-079
  v1.20 already registers Event 7, no further architect action owed (closes F-S2125-P2-003).

**(e) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: resolving findings does not itself advance the streak —
BOTH S-21.19 and S-21.25 LOCAL cascade streaks remain **0/3**. Fresh-context adversary pass-3 is
the next action for each: S-21.19 against S-21.19 v1.2 + S-21.24 v1.2 + BC-1.03.017 v1.19; S-21.25
against S-21.25 v1.2 + BC-1.03.019 v1.2 + BC-3.08.001 v1.26.

**(f) Drift item (recorded, not silently left bare).** BC-1.03.017 v1.18→v1.19's Invariant 7
re-anchor is **DEFERRED** for the not-yet-converging split-seam stories S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22 —
they still cite BC-1.03.017 v1.18 in their own `behavioral_contracts` frontmatter and BC-INDEX
Stories cell. Anchor: swept during each story's own Wave-7 pre-TDD convergence burst (avoids
re-sweeping all three siblings on every BC-1.03.017 amendment while S-21.19/S-21.20/S-21.21/
S-21.22/S-21.23 are still independently converging in Wave 6-7). Carried forward from D-1059(e):
BC-1.03.019's `VP-TBD` placeholder remains open — a real triggering-condition VP is still owed
(VP-079 covers only Event 7's wire-shape, not the `>90%` semantics); anchored to a Phase-6
formal-verifier / named VP-authoring pass follow-up, not this burst's scope.

**(g) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst registers/reconciles/records only for the
S-21.19-cluster (BC-1.03.017, S-21.19, S-21.24) and S-21.25-cluster (BC-1.03.019, BC-3.08.001,
`capabilities.md` verified unchanged, S-21.25) files already authored in the worktree at burst
start. It does NOT touch S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, or S-21.23 — their BC-1.03.017 re-anchor is the
explicit drift item in (f), NOT this burst's scope.

## D-1061 — D-1061-WAVE6-PASS3-REMEDIATION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1060`. This entry is D-1061, the next decision allocated after D-1060.

**Scope note (single-commit remediation burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053; atomic across BOTH
S-21.19 and S-21.25 clusters).** Per D-1057(k), each split seam requires its own independent
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD entry. This entry records
pass-3 outcomes for BOTH the S-21.19 cluster (D-1060's remediated v1.2 bundle) and the S-21.25
cluster (D-1060's remediated v1.2 bundle), and their same-burst remediations, as one atomic Wave-6
burst.

**(a) S-21.19 pre-TDD adversary pass-3 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 1 MEDIUM + 1 LOW finding, no
BLOCKER/HIGH. Pass-2's F-S2119-P2-001/002 (BC-1.03.017 Invariant 7 wiring re-key; AC-009
`#[ignore]` gate) independently re-verified FIXED — not reopened; ADR-044's own capstone-flip
split (D-1058, pass 1) also re-confirmed held. **F-S2119-P3-001** (MEDIUM): Task 2's
`test_no_on_error_block_without_fail_closed_when_3arg_executor` (AC-012) cite was still
`BC-1.03.017 v1.18 PC11` — a stale live cite the pass-2 sweep missed, despite that pass's own
changelog claiming "all 18 body cites re-anchored." Whitespace-normalized detector confirmed
4 live `v1.18` occurrences pre-fix (the Task-2 cite + 3 historical-changelog-exempt), 0 post-fix;
true count now 19/19 live `BC-1.03.017` cites swept. **F-S2119-P3-002** (LOW): S-21.19's `blocks:`
frontmatter omitted `S-21.24` despite S-21.24's `depends_on:` directly listing S-21.19 (S-21.24
Task 0 consumes S-21.19's dormant 3-arg extension per ADR-044) — an asymmetric depends_on/blocks
pair, and the STORY-INDEX D-1057 sub-schedule DAG narrative only showed the transitive path, not
the direct edge the fixed asymmetry implies. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.19-local-pass-3.md`.

**(b) S-21.19 resolution — both findings fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral.**
- `vsdd-factory:story-writer` (S-21.19 v1.2→v1.3, input-hash `e6f82f2` unchanged): swept Task 2's
  stale `BC-1.03.017 v1.18 PC11` cite to `v1.19 PC11` (closes F-S2119-P3-001); independently
  re-verified `BC-1.01.016` already correctly anchored at v1.3 throughout, no drift. Added
  `S-21.24` to `blocks:` (now `[S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23, S-21.24]`) for bidirectional
  depends_on/blocks parity with S-21.24 (closes F-S2119-P3-002). Zero points/wave change.
- `vsdd-factory:state-manager` (this burst): added the direct S-21.19→S-21.24 edge to the
  STORY-INDEX D-1057 sub-schedule DAG narrative (verified acyclic — same direction as the existing
  transitive path through S-21.20-23), completing F-S2119-P3-002's fix on the index side.

**(c) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-3 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 2 MEDIUM findings, no BLOCKER/HIGH.
Pass-2's F-S2125-P2-001 (AC-005 self-match/RED-GREEN inversion) independently re-verified FIXED
with no recurrence — the structural class of defect genuinely cannot recur under the relocated
`concat!`-needle design. **F-S2125-P3-001** (MEDIUM): Task 7 and Task 11's "18 test functions
total — 17 in `invoke.rs` + 1 separate" narrative silently dropped the 3 `emit_event.rs`
field-shape tests (AC-006×1, AC-008×2) that the File Structure Requirements table has always
placed in that file — the accurate distribution is 14 (invoke.rs) + 3 (emit_event.rs) + 1
(separate integration file) = 18. **F-S2125-P3-002** (MEDIUM): S-21.25's VP status note justified
only the BC-1.03.019 VP-TBD deferral and was silent on VP-079 v1.20's independent registration of
this story's emission as SITE_7 and VP-079's own note tracking the SITE_7 fixture "for the
test-writer at S-21.25 delivery time" — leaving the relationship and its deferral target
unaddressed from this story's side. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-3.md`.

**(d) S-21.25 resolution — both findings fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral (bidirectional
fix for F-S2125-P3-002).**
- `vsdd-factory:story-writer` (S-21.25 v1.2→v1.3, input-hash `4af3ec2` unchanged): corrected
  Task 7 and Task 11 to state the accurate 14/3/1 test distribution, naming which ACs land in
  which file (closes F-S2125-P3-001). Extended the VP status note with an explicit "VP-079 SITE_7
  acknowledgment" paragraph naming the VP-079 SITE_7/BC-3.08.001 Event 7 relationship and stating
  the SITE_7 mutation-counter-proof fixture is DEFERRED to Phase-6 formal-verification — a named,
  concrete deferral, not silence (contributes to closing F-S2125-P3-002).
- `vsdd-factory:architect` (VP-079 v1.20→v1.21, input-hash `704a8ca`→`2b508d4`, orchestrator scope
  adjudication concurrent with the story-writer fix above): retargeted Property 6's SITE_7 scope
  note and the §Feasibility Assessment Proof-complexity row from "tracked for the test-writer at
  S-21.25 delivery time" to Phase-6 formal-verification, matching the orchestrator's adjudication
  that the SITE_7 mutation-fixture (async-event-schema-conformance + cargo-mutants SITES/filter
  extension) is VP-079's own Phase-6 infrastructure obligation, not S-21.25's pre-TDD/unit scope
  (closes F-S2125-P3-002 in full — both artifacts now agree bidirectionally).

**(e) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: resolving findings does not itself advance the streak —
BOTH S-21.19 and S-21.25 LOCAL cascade streaks remain **0/3**. Fresh-context adversary pass-4 is
the next action for each: S-21.19 against S-21.19 v1.3 + BC-1.03.017 v1.19; S-21.25 against
S-21.25 v1.3 + BC-1.03.019 v1.2 + VP-079 v1.21.

**(f) Drift item (carried forward, not silently left bare).** Carried forward from D-1060(f):
BC-1.03.017 v1.18→v1.19's Invariant 7 re-anchor remains **DEFERRED** for the not-yet-converging
split-seam stories S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22 — unchanged this burst, out of scope (see (g)). Carried
forward from D-1059(e)/D-1060(f): BC-1.03.019's `VP-TBD` placeholder remains open — a real
triggering-condition VP is still owed; anchored to a Phase-6 formal-verifier / named VP-authoring
pass follow-up, not this burst's scope. **New this burst:** the STORY-INDEX D-1057 sub-schedule
blockquote's POLICY 18 input-hash enumeration stopped before the split stories (S-21.19-S-21.25),
so the three-way frontmatter=catalog-row=blockquote parity could not be asserted for them — both
this pass and the S-21.25 pass-3 review independently flagged this LOW process-gap. Closed this
burst: the blockquote now enumerates all seven split stories' current input-hashes. A pre-existing,
unrelated coincidence was surfaced (not introduced, not remediated) during that sweep: S-21.20 and
S-21.23 currently share the identical input-hash `cbbc8dd` — flagged for awareness in the
blockquote text; not investigated or fixed this burst (out of scope; no adversary finding raised
it).

**(g) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst registers/reconciles/records only for the
S-21.19-cluster (S-21.19) and S-21.25-cluster (S-21.25, VP-079) files already authored in the
worktree at burst start, plus the STORY-INDEX D-1057 sub-schedule DAG/blockquote bookkeeping. It
does NOT touch S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23, S-21.24, BC-1.03.017, BC-1.03.019, or
BC-3.08.001 themselves — no BC/ADR content changed this pass-3 round.

### Agents

- state-manager (this burst): input-hash reconciliation via the per-file operator
  `compute-input-hash` binary (POLICY 18; never dev-source `--scan --update` per D-952) — VP-079
  (`704a8ca`→`2b508d4`); S-21.19/S-21.25 verified already current (`--check` exit 0, no update
  needed). New `adv-s21.19-local-pass-3.md` and `adv-s21.25-local-pass-3.md` persisted (Part A/B +
  Disposition + Summary + Novelty Assessment sections each). STORY-INDEX D-1057 sub-schedule DAG
  direct 19→24 edge added + POLICY 18 blockquote input-hash enumeration extended to all seven
  split stories. INDEX.md per-story cascade sections (new pass-3 rows) + both Convergence Status

## D-1062 — D-1062-WAVE6-PASS4-REMEDIATION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1061`. This entry is D-1062, the next decision allocated after D-1061.

**Scope note (single-commit remediation burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053; atomic across BOTH
S-21.19 and S-21.25 clusters).** Per D-1057(k), each split seam requires its own independent
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD entry. This entry records
pass-4 outcomes for BOTH the S-21.19 cluster (D-1061's remediated v1.3 bundle) and the S-21.25
cluster (D-1061's remediated v1.3 bundle), and their same-burst remediations, plus a comprehensive
proactive STORY-INDEX/BC-INDEX/VP-INDEX cross-reference hygiene sweep across the split-story
cluster, as one atomic Wave-6 burst.

**(a) S-21.19 pre-TDD adversary pass-4 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 1 MEDIUM finding, no BLOCKER/HIGH/LOW,
plus 2 non-resetting cross-story observations. Pass-3's F-S2119-P3-001/002 (Task 2 stale
`BC-1.03.017 v1.18` cite; `blocks:`/`depends_on:` asymmetry) independently re-verified FIXED — not
reopened; ADR-044's capstone-flip split (D-1058) and the Invariant-7 wiring re-key + AC-009
`#[ignore]` gate (D-1060) also re-confirmed held. **F-S2119-P4-001** (MEDIUM, STORY-INDEX-domain —
the S-21.19 story file itself is UNCHANGED this round, stays v1.3): the D-1057 sub-schedule
blockquote (STORY-INDEX.md ~line 751) still read `S-21.19 (9 pts)` and `S-21.24 (3 pts)` in its
mid-list W6/W8 prose — stale since D-1058's ADR-044 capstone-owned-flip redistribution (9→7 for
S-21.19, 3→5 for S-21.24), which had already correctly updated both catalog rows and both stories'
frontmatter `points:` fields at the time. The blockquote's own mid-list text was the only
un-swept site, masked through passes 2-3 because the blockquote's stated aggregate total (35 pts,
S-21.19..S-21.24) is points-neutral under the 9/3↔7/5 swap (9+3=12=7+5). Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.19-local-pass-4.md`.

**(b) S-21.19 resolution — finding fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral.**
- `vsdd-factory:state-manager` (this burst; STORY-INDEX-domain fix, no story-writer dispatch
  required — the S-21.19/S-21.24 story files themselves are unchanged): swept the D-1057
  sub-schedule blockquote's mid-list points `S-21.19 (9 pts)`→`(7 pts)` and
  `S-21.24 (3 pts)`→`(5 pts)`, verified against every catalog row's points column and both
  stories' frontmatter (all four now consistent at 7/5).
- Cross-story audit (dispatched alongside this remediation, recorded as observations
  O-S2119-P4-001/002 in the pass-4 review, not counted toward this pass's severity total):
  BC-INDEX's BC-1.03.017 Stories column incorrectly listed S-21.23 as a citer — S-21.23's own
  frontmatter cites only `BC-1.03.018 v1.1`, never BC-1.03.017. `vsdd-factory:state-manager`
  corrected the Stories column, removing S-21.23 (now reads S-21.10, S-21.19, S-21.20, S-21.21,
  S-21.22, S-21.24). S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22's own stale `BC-1.03.017 v1.18` cites (BC itself now
  at v1.19) were confirmed as real, pre-existing drift but explicitly NOT swept this burst — see
  (f)/(g).

**(c) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-4 verdict.** NOT-CLEAN. 1 MEDIUM finding, no BLOCKER/HIGH/LOW.
Pass-3's F-S2125-P3-001 (Task 7/11 test-distribution miscount) independently re-verified FIXED with
no recurrence. F-S2125-P3-002 (VP-079 SITE_7 silence) verified FIXED in substance — the story is no
longer silent — but the fix-verification surfaced a follow-on, distinct failure mode:
**F-S2125-P4-001** (MEDIUM, concurrency residue): pass-3's F-S2125-P3-002 remediation was split
across two concurrent same-burst agents — story-writer authored S-21.25's VP-079 SITE_7
acknowledgment paragraph citing `VP-079 v1.20` (current at the instant it was written), while
architect concurrently bumped VP-079 itself v1.20→v1.21 (retargeting the same SITE_7 scope note's
ownership language). Both edits were individually correct when written, but the combination left
S-21.25 v1.3 citing and quoting a superseded VP-079 version at all 5 live sites (VP-status note,
Context/Finding-Summary, Architecture Mapping table, Task 5, Architecture Compliance Rules table)
by the time the D-1061 burst closed — including presenting v1.20's now-superseded SITE_7 sentence
as VP-079's present-tense text. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-4.md`.

**(d) S-21.25 resolution — finding fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral.**
- `vsdd-factory:story-writer` (S-21.25 v1.3→v1.4, input-hash `4af3ec2` unchanged — body-only edit;
  VP-079 is not in S-21.25's own `inputs:` dependency list): swept `VP-079 v1.20`→`v1.21` at all 5
  live sites; reframed the VP-status note's quotation as a paraphrase of VP-079 v1.21's actual
  current SITE_7 text (Phase-6 formal-verification tracking, explicitly NOT S-21.25's pre-TDD/unit
  scope), with v1.20's superseded text now explicitly named as historical carry-forward context
  rather than quoted as VP-079's present tense. Residual `v1.20` cites confirmed to be only the
  exempt historical Changelog/`modified:` rows for v1.2/v1.3 (which correctly narrate what v1.20
  said at the time it was written).

**(e) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: resolving findings does not itself advance the streak —
BOTH S-21.19 and S-21.25 LOCAL cascade streaks remain **0/3**. Fresh-context adversary pass-5 is
the next action for each: S-21.19 against S-21.19 v1.3 + STORY-INDEX v4.377 + BC-INDEX v4.86;
S-21.25 against S-21.25 v1.4 + BC-1.03.019 v1.2 + VP-079 v1.21.

**(f) Drift item (carried forward, not silently left bare).** Carried forward from D-1060(f)/
D-1061(f): BC-1.03.017 v1.18→v1.19's Invariant 7 re-anchor remains **DEFERRED** for the
not-yet-converging split-seam stories S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22 — unchanged this burst, out of scope
(see (g)); confirmed still accurate by this burst's cross-story audit. **New this burst:** VP-079's
own citation of `BC-3.08.001 v1.25` (at VP-079's Property-Statement opening parenthetical and its
Property-6 SITE_7 site-description sentence) is itself one version behind — BC-3.08.001 advanced to
v1.26 at D-1060 (F-S2125-P2-003's false-flag closure + emitter-rename sweep). VP-079's own §Amendment
2026-08-20 (v1.20→v1.21) entry, added at D-1061, already correctly cites `BC-3.08.001 v1.26`, so
this is a within-file inconsistency, not a wholesale staleness — flagged for the architect's next
VP-079 touch (not this burst's scope; VP-079 content is architect's domain, and no adversary finding
against S-21.19 or S-21.25 raised it — it was noticed incidentally during this burst's comprehensive
cross-reference sweep and is recorded here so it is not silently lost).

**(g) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst registers/reconciles/records only for the
S-21.19-cluster (S-21.19, STORY-INDEX, BC-INDEX) and S-21.25-cluster (S-21.25) files already
authored in the worktree at burst start (S-21.25 v1.4) or fixed directly by state-manager
(STORY-INDEX blockquote, BC-INDEX Stories column), plus the comprehensive cross-reference sweep
explicitly requested this burst. It does NOT touch S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23, S-21.24,
BC-1.03.017, BC-1.03.018, BC-1.03.019, BC-3.08.001, or VP-079 themselves — no BC/ADR/VP content
changed this pass-4 round; the VP-079 BC-3.08.001 stale-cite item at (f) is recorded, not fixed,
per this scope boundary.

### Agents

- story-writer: S-21.25 v1.3→v1.4 — already present in the worktree at burst start
- state-manager (this burst): STORY-INDEX D-1057 sub-schedule blockquote mid-list points swept
  9/3→7/5; BC-INDEX BC-1.03.017 Stories column corrected (S-21.23 removed); input-hash
  reconciliation via the per-file operator `compute-input-hash` binary (POLICY 18; never
  dev-source `--scan --update`) — `adv-s21.19-local-pass-4.md` and `adv-s21.25-local-pass-4.md`
  computed and stamped (`c1bae4e`, `622af2b`); S-21.25 verified already current
  (`--check`-equivalent frontmatter comparison, no update needed, `4af3ec2`). New
  `adv-s21.19-local-pass-4.md` and `adv-s21.25-local-pass-4.md` persisted (Part A/B + Disposition +
  Summary + Novelty Assessment sections each, plus S-21.19's Cross-Story Observations section).
  STORY-INDEX and BC-INDEX per-story/per-BC row notes appended. INDEX.md per-story cascade sections
  (new pass-4 rows) + both Convergence Status blocks. This D-1062 decision-log.md entry. STATE.md

## D-1063 — D-1063-WAVE6-PASS5-REMEDIATION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1062`. This entry is D-1063, the next decision allocated after D-1062.

**Scope note (single-commit remediation burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053; atomic across BOTH
S-21.19 and S-21.25 clusters).** Per D-1057(k), each split seam requires its own independent
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD entry. This entry records
pass-5 outcomes for BOTH the S-21.19 cluster (D-1062's remediated v1.3 bundle) and the S-21.25
cluster (D-1062's remediated v1.4 bundle), and their same-burst remediations, as one atomic
Wave-6 burst.

**(a) S-21.19 pre-TDD adversary pass-5 verdict.** **CLEAN — first clean pass.** The adversary
re-derived every anchor in the S-21.19 v1.3 bundle fresh-context (BC-1.03.017 v1.19, BC-1.01.016
v1.3, ADR-044, ADR-039 v1.15, sibling S-21.24 v1.2, source-grounded against
`crates/factory-dispatcher/src/executor.rs`) and found zero streak-resetting findings localized to
S-21.19's own perimeter. LOCAL BC-5.39.001 streak **ADVANCES 0/3→1/3**; pass-6 next. Novelty LOW.
Full verbatim review: `.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.19-local-pass-5.md`.

**(b) S-21.19 cross-story finding — fixed in scope, does not reset S-21.19's own streak.**
**F-S2119-P5-001** (MEDIUM, POLICY 4 / partial-fix-regression S-7.01(c)):
`.factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md` §3 intro (~line 424) read "…every AC has exactly
one owning story, except the two explicitly noted cross-seam splits (AC-007, AC-013b)…" — stale
since the F-S2119-P1-001 remediation (D-1058) made AC-002 and AC-011 cross-seam splits too. The
partition table (~L429/L438) and verification arithmetic (~L479-480: "AC-002 (2 legs) + AC-007 (2
legs) + AC-011 (2 legs) + AC-013b (2 legs) = 4 ACs, 8 legs") already correctly enumerated FOUR
splits — only the intro prose lagged.
- `vsdd-factory:state-manager` (this burst): changed "the two explicitly noted cross-seam splits
  (AC-007, AC-013b)" → "the four explicitly noted cross-seam splits (AC-002, AC-007, AC-011,
  AC-013b)", preserving the "two legs, one owner apiece" mechanic clause. Literal-shell
  verification (D-449(a)):
  ```
  $ grep -n "cross-seam split" .factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md
  424:duplications** — every AC has exactly one owning story, except the four explicitly noted
  424:cross-seam splits (AC-002, AC-007, AC-011, AC-013b), each of which has exactly two legs with one owner apiece.
  ```
  Zero occurrences of the stale "the two … cross-seam splits" phrasing remain. Input-hash
  reconciled via operator-authoritative rc.23 `compute-input-hash --update` (POLICY 18):
  `937a3a9`→`bc7c141`.
- Three non-resetting observations documented (O-S2119-P5-001 ADVISORY cosmetic version-token
  inconsistency; O-S2119-P5-002 not-a-finding, POLICY 7 editorial-abbreviation exception applies;
  O-S2119-P5-003 LOW out-of-perimeter, BC-1.01.016's `CAP-TBD` already covered by the sanctioned
  D-1021 deferral) — no action required.

**(c) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-5 verdict.** **NOT-CLEAN — 2 MEDIUM, streak REMAINS 0/3.**
The S-21.25 v1.4 story body itself is CLEAN — the adversary independently re-derived all 7
previously-named risk areas (emitter-name parity, AC-005 self-match/RED-GREEN, test-distribution
14/3/1=18, threshold-predicate testability, BC-3.08.001 Event-7 field-set, message-text parity,
three-way input-hash parity `4af3ec2`) and confirmed all 7 sound. Both findings are index-
propagation residue from the Event-7 registration cluster (concurrency-residue, split across
agents at prior bursts) — NOT a story defect, and resolving them does NOT advance S-21.19's or
S-21.25's own streaks. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-5.md`.

**(d) S-21.25 resolution — both findings fixed in scope, no BLOCKER, no deferral.**
- **F-S2125-P5-001** (MEDIUM, POLICY 4 DESCRIPTION-BEARING ANCHOR-PROSE PARITY / POLICY 9):
  `.factory/specs/verification-properties/VP-INDEX.md` (~line 527), the VP-079 §Story Anchors row
  read "…all six async-semantics event types (…) per BC-3.08.001 v1.19." VP-079 is now v1.21 and
  its own §Full Index row already correctly enumerates seven event types (adds
  `plugin.fuel_headroom_warning`, swept at v1.20/D-1059); BC-3.08.001 is now v1.26. `state-manager`
  (this burst): swept six→seven, added `plugin.fuel_headroom_warning` to the enumeration, and
  replaced the trailing load-bearing `v1.19` version pin with the stable unpinned form
  `per BC-3.08.001` (POLICY 19 spirit — anchor-prose rows should not carry a version token that
  goes stale on every subsequent BC amendment). VP-INDEX v2.78→v2.79.
- **F-S2125-P5-002** (MEDIUM, BC-INDEX-mirrors-BC-file / anchor-back propagation):
  `.factory/specs/behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` (~line 769) BC-3.08.001 Stories column read
  "S-15.01, S-19.05" but BC-3.08.001's own §Traceability Stories row (line 394) and §Story Anchor
  (line 335) name S-21.25 as the Event-7 anchor story — precedent: S-19.05 (Event 6) IS in the
  column. `state-manager` (this burst): appended `, S-21.25` to the BC-3.08.001 Stories column.
  BC-INDEX v4.86→v4.87. `total_bcs` UNCHANGED 1987 (column-cell fix only, no new BC, no BC prose
  change).
- One non-resetting observation: VP-079's own frontmatter carries `modified: []` and no
  `last_amended` field despite 21 body `## Amendment` sections (POLICY 17 gap spanning VP-079's
  whole history — architect-owned, out of S-21.25's scope). Recorded as a NEW drift item anchored
  to the architect's next VP-079 touch, alongside the existing D-1062 VP-079 BC-3.08.001
  v1.25→v1.26 stale-cite drift item (a distinct, still-open item, NOT re-fixed this burst).

**(e) Process-gap recurrence (recorded, not a new codification).** Both S-21.25 findings confirm a
recurrence of the existing anchored class D-1044(g)/D-995 (governing-BC-bump lacks same-burst
story-propagation-dispatch discipline) one layer further out: the v1.25 Event-7 registration burst
(D-1059) self-deferred the BC-INDEX Stories-column leg and the VP-INDEX §Story Anchors leg of its
own propagation. Per explicit dispatch instruction, no new follow-up story is opened; recorded as a
recurrence anchored to the existing S-15.03 PRIORITY-A candidate (a POLICY-14-leg-5 same-burst
index-Stories-column sweep gate). See `lessons.md` recurrence note appended this burst.

**(f) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: S-21.19's LOCAL cascade streak **ADVANCES 0/3→1/3** (first
clean pass); S-21.25's LOCAL cascade streak **REMAINS 0/3** (resolving index-propagation residue
does not itself advance the streak). Fresh-context adversary pass-6 is the next action for each:
S-21.19 against S-21.19 v1.3 (UNCHANGED) + STORY-INDEX v4.378 + BC-INDEX v4.87; S-21.25 against
S-21.25 v1.4 (UNCHANGED) + BC-1.03.019 v1.2 + VP-079 v1.21 + VP-INDEX v2.79 + BC-INDEX v4.87.

**(g) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst registers/reconciles/records only for the
S-21.19-cluster (decomposition-plan.md, STORY-INDEX/BC-INDEX cross-reference cells already
identified by the pass-5 finding sets) and S-21.25-cluster (VP-INDEX, BC-INDEX cross-reference
cells). It does NOT touch S-21.19, S-21.24, S-21.25, BC-1.03.017, BC-1.03.018, BC-1.03.019,
BC-3.08.001, VP-079, or ADR-039/ADR-044 body content themselves — no BC/ADR/VP/story prose changed
this pass-5 round on either cluster; the VP-079 POLICY 17 frontmatter gap and the pre-existing
D-1062 VP-079 BC-3.08.001 stale-cite item are recorded, not fixed, per this scope boundary.

### Agents

- state-manager (this burst): `.factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md` §3 intro fixed
  (two→four cross-seam splits) + input-hash reconciled (`937a3a9`→`bc7c141` via operator rc.23
  binary); `VP-INDEX.md` §Story Anchors VP-079 row fixed (six→seven + version pin removed);
  `BC-INDEX.md` BC-3.08.001 Stories column fixed (`, S-21.25` appended); `STORY-INDEX.md` S-21.19
  and S-21.25 catalog rows annotated with D-1063 outcomes. New
  `adv-s21.19-local-pass-5.md` (CLEAN) and `adv-s21.25-local-pass-5.md` (NOT-CLEAN) persisted
  (input-hash reconciled via operator rc.23 binary: `3314959`, `11f321d`). INDEX.md both LOCAL
  Adversary Reviews sections gained a pass-5 row + Convergence Status advance. This D-1063
  decision-log.md entry. lessons.md process-gap recurrence note appended. burst-log.md 8-block
  entry appended. STATE.md advance (un-pause ACTIVE, Phase Progress row, Story Status, Blocking
  Issues, Drift Items, Session Resume Checkpoint). Single atomic commit to `factory-artifacts` per
  TD-VSDD-053.

### 4-INDEX

BC-INDEX v4.86→v4.87 (BC-3.08.001 Stories column correction) / ARCH-INDEX v3.76 UNCHANGED (no ADR
content changed this burst) / VP-INDEX v2.78→v2.79 (VP-079 §Story Anchors row six→seven + version
pin removed) / STORY-INDEX v4.377→v4.378 (S-21.19 pass-5 CLEAN annotation; S-21.25 pass-5
NOT-CLEAN-remediated annotation; both story files themselves unchanged).

## D-1064 — D-1064-WAVE6-PASS6-REMEDIATION

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1063`. This entry is D-1064, the next decision allocated after D-1063.

**Scope note (single-commit remediation burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053; atomic across BOTH
S-21.19 and S-21.25 clusters).** Per D-1057(k), each split seam requires its own independent
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade before Phase-3 TDD entry. This entry records
pass-6 outcomes for BOTH the S-21.19 cluster (D-1063's remediated v1.3 bundle) and the S-21.25
cluster (D-1063's remediated v1.4 bundle), and their same-burst remediations (two specialist legs —
product-owner and story-writer — plus this state-manager close-out), as one atomic Wave-6 burst.

**(a) S-21.19 pre-TDD adversary pass-6 verdict.** **CLEAN — second consecutive clean pass.** The
adversary re-derived every anchor in the S-21.19 v1.3 bundle fresh-context (BC-1.03.017 v1.19,
BC-1.01.016 v1.3, ADR-044, ADR-039 v1.15, sibling S-21.24 v1.2, decomposition plan §3 four-splits
confirmed, 19→24 DAG edge confirmed) and found zero streak-resetting findings localized to
S-21.19's own perimeter. Novelty LOW. LOCAL BC-5.39.001 streak **ADVANCES 1/3→2/3**; pass-7 next —
one more CLEAN pass converges 3/3. S-21.19 story file itself UNCHANGED this burst, stays v1.3.
Full verbatim review: `.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.19-local-pass-6.md`.

**(b) S-21.19 non-resetting cross-artifact drift (recorded, not fixed this burst — cross-perimeter,
covered by/extending existing sanctioned deferrals).**
- **F-S2119-P6-001** (LOW): residual `BC-1.03.017 v1.18` cites in
  `.factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md` §1 per-story detail (~lines 104, 128, 138, 167,
  201, 294) AND in STORY-INDEX sibling rows for S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22/S-21.23. This EXTENDS the
  existing D-1060 deferral (BC-1.03.017 v1.19 re-anchor for S-21.20/21/22, anchored each story's own
  Wave-7 pre-TDD convergence) to explicitly also cover these decomposition-plan §1 sites and the
  S-21.23 row. Not fixed this burst per scope discipline — cross-perimeter, does not touch S-21.19's
  own body or streak.
- **F-S2119-P6-002** (LOW): `ADR-044` body cites `BC-1.03.017 v1.18` at approximately lines 35, 104,
  190. New drift item, anchored the architect's next ADR-044 touch. Not load-bearing for S-21.19's
  own implementability.
- **O-S2119-P6-003** (observation, no action this burst): BC-1.03.017 PC10 prose (~lines 513-515)
  uses pre-split single-PR phrasing ("Both the unit test revision and the TC-12 integration revision
  MUST appear in the PR diff") not updated for the S-21.19-unit / S-21.24-TC-12 two-PR split under
  ADR-044. Product-owner's domain; drift item anchored next BC-1.03.017 touch.
- **O-S2119-P6-001/002** (observations, no action): AC-trace version-token cosmetic inconsistency;
  ADR ratification-version pins are immutable historical provenance (not stale). Documented as
  documented/non-actionable.

**(c) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-6 verdict.** **NOT-CLEAN — 1 HIGH streak-resetting finding,
remediated same burst.** The adversary independently re-derived the story BODY as CLEAN across all
7 named risk areas (emitter-name parity, AC-005 self-match/RED-GREEN, test-distribution 14/3/1=18,
threshold-predicate testability, BC-3.08.001 Event-7 field-set, message-text parity, three-way
input-hash parity). One HIGH finding was located entirely in the governing BC's own Traceability
row, surfaced by a corpus-wide grep sweep for POLICY 19 compliance:
**F-S2125-P6-001** (HIGH, POLICY 19 `adr_version_cite_volatile_pin_prohibition`): BC-1.03.019's
Traceability ADR row carried a load-bearing `ADR-039 v1.15 §Decision 5 Mitigation 1` version pin —
the sole outlier in the entire BC corpus per adversary corpus-grep (every other BC Traceability ADR
row uses the stable `ADR-NNN §Decision N` section-anchor form). Sibling BC-3.08.001's Traceability
ADR row carried the same pattern for its Event-7 provenance clause.
- `vsdd-factory:product-owner` (this burst): rewrote BC-1.03.019's Traceability row to the stable
  form `ADR-039 §Decision 5 Mitigation 1 (WARN message per §Erratum E-006)`, relocating the
  v1.14→v1.15 version-delta provenance narrative into BC-1.03.019's own Changelog (BC-1.03.019
  v1.2→v1.3, `7368f5a`→`a350ee0` operator-binary-computed). Swept sibling BC-3.08.001's Traceability
  ADR row to `ADR-039 §Decision 5 Mitigation 1 (E-006)` in the same burst (BC-3.08.001 v1.26→v1.27,
  `9cc52d3`→`b64ffb3` operator-binary-computed).
- `vsdd-factory:story-writer` (this burst): swept all 13 live `BC-1.03.019 v1.2` citations in S-21.25
  to `v1.3` (`behavioral_contracts` frontmatter, Context/Finding-Summary governing-BC parenthetical,
  AC-006/AC-008 header trace tags + inline PC6/PC8 body cites, body BC table Version column, Token
  Budget governing-BC row, Task 1, Task 5, Architecture Compliance Rules table x3). BC-3.08.001
  v1.26→v1.27 citations in this story were all bare/unversioned — nothing to sweep. S-21.25
  v1.4→v1.5, `4af3ec2`→`eefe28b` operator-binary-computed (D-952 workaround). Resolving a HIGH does
  NOT advance the streak — S-21.25 LOCAL streak **REMAINS 0/3**; pass-7 next.

**(d) S-21.25 LOW findings.**
- **F-S2125-P6-002** (LOW): live §VP-Anchors closure bullet in BC-3.08.001 (~line 342) cited a bare
  `VP-079 v1.20` (now v1.21), even though the bullet is a historical closure record, not a live
  re-verification claim. `vsdd-factory:product-owner` (this burst): annotated the bullet
  `(VP-079 v1.20 at closure; now v1.21 — this bullet is a historical closure record and is not
  re-verified against the current VP-079 version; see v1.27 Changelog, F-S2125-P6-002)` — chose
  annotation over silent carry-forward or silent update, per the production-grade default that the
  bullet must accurately document what was true at closure time.
- **F-S2125-P6-003** (LOW, DEFERRED): VP-079 internal inconsistency — Proof-Harness-Skeleton header
  comments (~lines 149/482) still say "six" event types though the v1.21 Property Statement says
  "seven". Architect-owned, VP-079-internal, out of S-21.25's perimeter. New drift item anchored the
  architect's next VP-079 touch, folded alongside the existing D-1062 VP-079 BC-3.08.001-cite drift
  item and the VP-079 frontmatter `modified: []`/missing `last_amended` gap (O-S2125-P5-001).

**(e) Process-gap recurrence (recorded, not a new codification).** POLICY 19
(`adr_version_cite_volatile_pin_prohibition`) was never applied to BC-1.03.019's own Traceability
row across its v1.0→v1.2 authoring and 5 prior adversary passes — a governance-discipline gap that
only fresh-context corpus-grep surfaced at pass 6. Per explicit dispatch instruction, no new
follow-up story is opened; recorded as a recurrence-class candidate anchored to the existing
S-15.03 PRIORITY-A candidate (a tree-wide POLICY-19 Traceability-row sweep gate at BC-authoring
time). See `lessons.md` recurrence note appended this burst.

**(f) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: S-21.19's LOCAL cascade streak **ADVANCES 1/3→2/3** (second
consecutive clean pass); S-21.25's LOCAL cascade streak **REMAINS 0/3** (resolving a HIGH does not
advance the streak). Fresh-context adversary pass-7 is the next action for each: S-21.19 against
S-21.19 v1.3 (UNCHANGED) + STORY-INDEX v4.379 + BC-INDEX v4.88; S-21.25 against S-21.25 v1.5 +
BC-1.03.019 v1.3 + BC-3.08.001 v1.27.

**(g) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst registers/reconciles/records for the S-21.19-cluster
(cross-artifact drift items only, no story/BC content touched) and the S-21.25-cluster
(BC-1.03.019, BC-3.08.001 Traceability rows + S-21.25 cite-propagation). It does NOT touch VP-079
body content, ADR-039/ADR-044 body content, or S-21.19/S-21.24 story content themselves this burst.

## D-1065 — D-1065-WAVE6-PASS7-SEAL

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1064`. This entry is D-1065, the next decision allocated after D-1064.

**Scope note (single-commit BOOKKEEPING-ONLY burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053; atomic across BOTH
S-21.19 and S-21.25 clusters; last and only agent this burst).** Per D-1057(k), each split seam
requires its own independent BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade before Phase-3
TDD entry. This entry records pass-7 outcomes for BOTH the S-21.19 cluster (D-1064's remediated
v1.3 bundle, UNCHANGED) and the S-21.25 cluster (D-1064's remediated v1.5 bundle, UNCHANGED). Both
pass-7 verdicts were CLEAN. No spec/story/BC/VP content was changed this burst — this is a pure
convergence-bookkeeping and index-annotation burst.

**(a) S-21.19 pre-TDD adversary pass-7 verdict.** **CLEAN — THIRD consecutive clean pass —
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN CONVERGENCE ACHIEVED.** The adversary re-derived every anchor in the S-21.19
v1.3 bundle fresh-context (BC-1.03.017 v1.19, BC-1.01.016 v1.3, ADR-044, ADR-039 v1.15, sibling
S-21.24 v1.2, STORY-INDEX v4.379, BC-INDEX v4.88) and found zero streak-resetting findings
localized to S-21.19's own perimeter, for the third consecutive independent fresh-context pass
(passes 5, 6, 7 all CLEAN). Novelty LOW ("findings absent, not refined" — the perimeter has been
stable and empty across three consecutive passes). LOCAL BC-5.39.001 streak **ADVANCES 2/3 → 3/3 =
3-CLEAN CONVERGENCE ACHIEVED**. S-21.19's pre-TDD adversarial convergence cascade is now COMPLETE —
it drops out of the LOCAL adversary loop; no further passes required. Story file itself UNCHANGED
this burst, stays v1.3 (`e6f82f2`). Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.19-local-pass-7.md`.

**S-21.19 is now eligible for Phase-3 TDD entry** (pending the orchestrator's/human's
wave-sequencing decision — start now vs hold for the remaining six split-story seams
S-21.20..S-21.24 to also converge). **This burst does NOT start TDD** — recorded as
CONVERGED-AWAITING-TDD-SEQUENCING per explicit dispatch scoping.

**(b) S-21.19 confirmed-still-anchored deferred cross-artifact items (NOT re-litigated this pass).**
The following items, recorded and deferred at prior passes, remain correctly anchored to their
existing owners and were reconfirmed still open by pass-7 without re-argument or re-scoping:
- `.factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md` §1 + STORY-INDEX sibling rows for
  S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22/S-21.23 still citing `BC-1.03.017 v1.18` — anchored to each sibling
  story's own Wave-7 pre-TDD convergence burst (D-1060 deferral, EXTENDED at D-1064/F-S2119-P6-001).
- `ADR-044` body citing `BC-1.03.017 v1.18` at approximately lines 35, 104, 190 — anchored to the
  architect's next ADR-044 touch (D-1064/F-S2119-P6-002).
- `BC-1.01.016`'s sanctioned `CAP-TBD` placeholder anchor — SANCTIONED cycle-wide deferral per
  D-1021, out-of-perimeter for per-story cascades, anchored S-15.03 PRIORITY-A.

**(c) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-7 verdict.** **CLEAN — first clean pass since the pass-6
POLICY 19 HIGH.** The adversary independently re-derived the story BODY as CLEAN across all 7
previously-named risk areas (emitter-name parity, AC-005 self-match/RED-GREEN, test-distribution
14/3/1=18, threshold-predicate testability, BC-3.08.001 Event-7 field-set, message-text parity,
POLICY 18 three-way input-hash parity — frontmatter=catalog-row=blockquote, all `eefe28b`).
F-S2125-P6-001 (POLICY 19 ADR-version-pin fix) and F-S2125-P6-002 (VP-079-cite dated annotation)
were both VERIFIED FIXED and held under a repeated corpus-wide POLICY 19 grep sweep — no new
outlier found anywhere in the BC corpus. F-S2125-P6-003 (VP-079 internal six/seven inconsistency)
remains correctly deferred to the architect, not re-counted. Zero BLOCKER/HIGH/MEDIUM
(streak-resetting) findings. LOCAL BC-5.39.001 streak **ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3** — first clean pass
since the pass-6 reset; pass-8 next. Story file itself UNCHANGED this burst, stays v1.5
(`eefe28b`). Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-7.md`.

**(d) S-21.25 non-resetting LOW cosmetic observations (recorded, DEFERRED to a post-convergence
cosmetic sweep — mirrors the S-21.11 D-1055/D-1056 accumulated-nit deferral pattern; NOT fixed this
burst).**
- **F-S2125-P7-001** (LOW, shared): erratum-annotation phrasing differs between the two
  POLICY-19-compliant BC Traceability rows — BC-1.03.019 reads "(WARN message per §Erratum E-006)"
  vs BC-3.08.001 reads "(E-006)". Both compliant; purely wording. Anchor: post-convergence cosmetic
  sweep.
- **F-S2125-P7-002** (LOW, S-21.25-specific): Context parenthetical (~story line 100) conflates the
  current version cite `v1.3` with the governing BC's original 2026-08-20 authoring date. Cosmetic.
  Anchor: post-convergence cosmetic sweep.
- **F-S2125-P7-003** (LOW, pending-intent CONVENTION): AC-header BC-version tokens are asymmetric —
  only AC-006/AC-008 headers carry an explicit ", v1.3" token; the other eight carry none. All
  present cites are current (nothing stale). Convention question for orchestrator/human
  adjudication. Anchor: post-convergence cosmetic sweep / human convention call.
- **F-S2125-P7-004** (LOW, pending-intent CONVENTION, repo-wide): story frontmatter `last_amended`
  bare-date form (no "(v1.5)" version prefix) is the story-template norm across the WHOLE repo —
  NOT burst-introduced; changing it for S-21.25 alone would implicate every story. Anchor:
  repo-wide convention decision (S-15.03 PRIORITY-A), not a per-story fix.

**(e) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: S-21.19's LOCAL cascade streak **ADVANCES 2/3→3/3 =
CONVERGED**; cascade CLOSED, no further LOCAL passes. S-21.25's LOCAL cascade streak **ADVANCES
0/3→1/3** (first clean pass since the pass-6 reset). Fresh-context adversary pass-8 is the next
action for S-21.25 ONLY, against the S-21.25 v1.5 (UNCHANGED) bundle. No further LOCAL adversary
pass is scheduled for S-21.19 — its next action is the orchestrator's/human's Phase-3 TDD
wave-sequencing decision.

**(f) Backfill correction (in-scope, same row already being touched this burst).** While annotating
the S-21.19 STORY-INDEX catalog row for this burst's pass-7 outcome, state-manager found the D-1064
pass-6 CLEAN outcome had been recorded in STATE.md/decision-log.md/INDEX.md/lessons.md but the
corresponding STORY-INDEX body-row annotation clause for S-21.19 had been omitted at D-1064 (a
same-day gap in an adjacent burst, not this burst's own defect) — backfilled in-scope this burst,
immediately preceding the new D-1065 clause, per the production-grade default (fix defects found
in scope rather than deferring or merely flagging). Separately, a scrivener typo in the S-21.25
row's own D-1064 clause ("pass-6 next" where the surrounding narrative describes pass-6 itself,
should read "pass-7 next") was also corrected in-scope, same edit.

**(g) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst is bookkeeping-only: it persists both pass-7
adversary review files, updates INDEX.md (both LOCAL Adversary Reviews sections + Convergence
Status), updates STORY-INDEX.md (catalog-row annotations for both stories + the D-1064 backfill +
typo fix + version bump), updates this decision-log.md entry, burst-log.md, lessons.md, and
STATE.md. It does NOT touch any BC, VP, ADR, or story BODY content — BC-INDEX v4.88, VP-INDEX
v2.79, and ARCH-INDEX v3.76 are all UNCHANGED this burst (no BC/VP/ADR content changed). No TDD
work is started this burst for S-21.19 despite its convergence.

### Agents

- state-manager (sole agent this burst, last and only agent, POLICY 3): persisted
  `adv-s21.19-local-pass-7.md` (CLEAN, 3-CLEAN CONVERGENCE, input-hash `80b6c8d`
  operator-binary-computed) and `adv-s21.25-local-pass-7.md` (CLEAN, streak 1/3, 4 LOW deferred,
  input-hash `4f8a9a3` operator-binary-computed); INDEX.md both LOCAL Adversary Reviews sections
  gained a pass-7 row + Convergence Status advance (S-21.19 → 3/3 CONVERGED, cascade CLOSED;
  S-21.25 → 1/3); STORY-INDEX v4.379→v4.380 (S-21.19 catalog row gained the backfilled D-1064
  clause + new D-1065 CONVERGED-AWAITING-TDD-SEQUENCING clause; S-21.25 catalog row gained the
  D-1064 typo fix + new D-1065 clause); this D-1065 decision-log.md entry; burst-log.md 8-block
  entry; lessons.md entry (S-21.19 is the FIRST of the 7 split stories to converge its pre-TDD
  cascade); STATE.md full advance (frontmatter, Phase Progress row, Current Phase Steps, Decisions
  Log, Story Status, `[D-1057]` Blocking Issue row, trajectory-tail append, Session Resume
  Checkpoint). Single atomic commit to `factory-artifacts` per TD-VSDD-053.

### 4-INDEX

BC-INDEX v4.88 UNCHANGED (no BC content changed this burst) / ARCH-INDEX v3.76 UNCHANGED (no ADR
content changed this burst) / VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (no VP content changed this burst) /
STORY-INDEX v4.379→v4.380 (S-21.19 catalog row: D-1064 backfill clause + D-1065
CONVERGED-AWAITING-TDD-SEQUENCING clause; S-21.25 catalog row: D-1064 typo fix + D-1065 pass-7
CLEAN streak-1/3 clause).

## D-1066 — D-1066-WAVE6-COMPLETE

POLICY 16 GLOBAL-MAX GATE: `grep -n "^## D-" decision-log.md | tail -3` -> the prior recorded max
in this file is `## D-1065`. This entry is D-1066, the next decision allocated after D-1065.

**Scope note (single-commit BOOKKEEPING-ONLY burst, state-manager, TD-VSDD-053; fourth dispatch
attempt for this burst — three prior state-manager delegates died to API connection loss BEFORE
committing; none of the three prior attempts landed any commit, so this is a clean first
successful commit for this decision, not a recovery from a partial state).** Per D-1057(k), each
split seam requires its own independent BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN LOCAL pre-TDD adversarial cascade
before Phase-3 TDD entry. This entry records pass-8 and pass-9 outcomes for the S-21.25 cluster
against the byte-identical D-1064-remediated v1.5 bundle (input-hash `eefe28b`, UNCHANGED since
D-1064). Both pass-8 and pass-9 verdicts were CLEAN, completing S-21.25's BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN
convergence (passes 7, 8, 9). No spec/story/BC/VP content was changed this burst — this is a pure
convergence-bookkeeping and index-annotation burst.

**(a) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-8 verdict.** **CLEAN — second consecutive clean pass.** The
adversary re-derived every anchor in the S-21.25 v1.5 bundle fresh-context (BC-1.03.019 v1.3,
BC-3.08.001 v1.27, VP-079 v1.21, STORY-INDEX v4.380, BC-INDEX v4.88, VP-INDEX v2.79) and found zero
streak-resetting (BLOCKER/HIGH/MEDIUM) findings. All four pass-7 LOW cosmetic observations
(F-S2125-P7-001..004) confirmed still open and correctly deferred, no recurrence, no severity
change. LOCAL BC-5.39.001 streak **ADVANCES 1/3 → 2/3**. One new LOW finding: **F-S2125-P8-001**
(story body itself still carries load-bearing `ADR-039 v1.15 §Decision 5` version-pin cites at
five live sites — Task 1 ~L460, AC-008 ~L305/L309, Architecture Compliance Rules table ~L575,
Token Budget section ~L449, opening narrative ~L100 — now destabilized relative to the BC layer's
own D-1064 fix; POLICY 19's own scope textually applies to BC-Traceability-row cites, whether it
also reaches story-body narrative cites is a pending-intent CONVENTION question, not a mechanical
gate violation). Two new ADVISORY observations: **F-S2125-P8-002** (repeat of F-S2125-P7-004,
story frontmatter `last_amended` bare-date form, confirmed still the repo-wide story-template
norm) and **F-S2125-P8-003** (extends F-S2125-P7-003, AC-header/§References-row citation-convention
asymmetry). All three non-resetting, DEFERRED to a post-convergence cosmetic sweep. Full verbatim
review: `.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-8.md`.

**(b) S-21.25 pre-TDD adversary pass-9 verdict.** **CLEAN — THIRD consecutive clean pass —
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN CONVERGENCE ACHIEVED.** The adversary re-derived every anchor in the S-21.25
v1.5 bundle fresh-context and found zero streak-resetting findings for the third consecutive
independent pass. Pass-8's F-S2125-P8-001 (story-body version-pin cluster) was independently
re-derived and confirmed stable — recorded again as **F-S2125-P9-002** (continuation, same
pending-intent CONVENTION question, same five sites, unchanged since pass-8). One new LOW finding:
**F-S2125-P9-001** (narrative-precision — the story's `include_str!` fixture-loading precedent
citation points to `crates/hook-plugins/validate-heavy-op-delegation/tests/bundle_orphan_check.rs`,
which does not contain the cited pattern at a stable anchor; the actual precedent lives at
`crates/hook-plugins/validate-heavy-op-delegation/tests/unit.rs:585-586`; a citation-target defect,
not a functional defect — the story's own planned implementation does not depend on the citation
being correct). Both new findings non-resetting, DEFERRED to a post-convergence cosmetic sweep.
LOCAL BC-5.39.001 streak **ADVANCES 2/3 → 3/3 = 3-CLEAN CONVERGENCE ACHIEVED**. S-21.25's pre-TDD
adversarial convergence cascade is now COMPLETE — it drops out of the LOCAL adversary loop; no
further passes required. Story file itself UNCHANGED this burst, stays v1.5 (`eefe28b`), held
across all nine passes. Full verbatim review:
`.factory/cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-s21.25-local-pass-9.md`.

**S-21.25 is now eligible for Phase-3 TDD entry** — recorded **CONVERGED-AWAITING-TDD**, held per
explicit human decision this burst (per the dispatch scope: bookkeeping-only, TDD not started).

**(c) WAVE 6 COMPLETE.** With S-21.25's 3-CLEAN convergence at this pass, BOTH Wave-6 seams have
now independently reached full BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN convergence on their pre-TDD LOCAL cascades:
S-21.19 (7 passes, CONVERGED at D-1065) and S-21.25 (9 passes, CONVERGED at this entry). Per
D-1057(k), splitting a converged spec does not inherit convergence for the split parts — each of
the 7 new stories must independently earn its own 3-CLEAN streak. Wave 6 (the two seams with zero
DAG dependencies blocking their own convergence work) is now fully closed. **NEXT: Wave 7** —
S-21.20, S-21.21, S-21.22, S-21.23 (each needs its own pre-TDD adversarial convergence starting
from pass-1; none has run yet). For S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22, dispatch story-writer to re-anchor
`BC-1.03.017 v1.18→v1.19` FIRST (the D-1060 Wave-7 deferral, extended at D-1064/F-S2119-P6-001 to
also cover `.factory/planning/S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md` §1 per-story detail sites and the
STORY-INDEX sibling rows), then each story's own pre-TDD adversary cascade pass-1. S-21.23 cites
only `BC-1.03.018` (confirmed at D-1062, does not cite `BC-1.03.017`) and can begin pass-1
directly, no re-anchor needed first. **Wave 8** — S-21.24 capstone (STRICTLY LAST, depends on all
five prior seams converging first) follows once Wave 7 converges.

**(d) S-21.25 accumulated non-resetting LOW/ADVISORY observations (recorded, DEFERRED to a
post-convergence cosmetic sweep — extends the D-1065 drift item; NOT fixed this burst).**
- **F-S2125-P7-001..004** (carried forward from D-1065, reconfirmed still open at both pass-8 and
  pass-9, no recurrence, no severity change): erratum-annotation phrasing wording difference;
  Context parenthetical version/date conflation; AC-header BC-version-token asymmetry
  (pending-intent CONVENTION); story frontmatter `last_amended` bare-date form (pending-intent
  CONVENTION, repo-wide, anchored S-15.03 PRIORITY-A).
- **F-S2125-P8-001** (LOW, extends the F-S2125-P7-001-class cluster with story-body-level detail):
  five story-body sites still cite `ADR-039 v1.15 §Decision 5`, destabilized relative to the BC
  layer's D-1064 fix; pending-intent CONVENTION question on POLICY 19's exact reach (BC-Traceability
  rows only, or also story-body narrative cites). Re-derived and confirmed stable at pass-9
  (F-S2125-P9-002).
- **F-S2125-P8-002/003** (ADVISORY): repeat/extension of F-S2125-P7-004 (frontmatter convention)
  and F-S2125-P7-003 (AC-header/reference-row convention asymmetry).
- **F-S2125-P9-001** (LOW, narrative-precision): `include_str!` precedent citation targets the
  wrong test file; correct citation is `tests/unit.rs:585-586`, not `tests/bundle_orphan_check.rs`.

All items above are anchored to a single future post-convergence cosmetic sweep for S-21.25 (this
extends, does not duplicate, the D-1065 drift item), or to a repo-wide S-15.03 PRIORITY-A
convention decision where noted. None require a mechanical fix before Phase-3 TDD entry — all are
cosmetic/convention questions, not correctness defects.

**(e) Streak discipline.** BC-5.39.001: S-21.25's LOCAL cascade streak **ADVANCES 1/3→2/3→3/3 =
CONVERGED** across this burst's two passes. Cascade CLOSED, no further LOCAL passes for S-21.25.
Combined with S-21.19's own convergence at D-1065, **both Wave-6 seams are now CONVERGED** —
Wave 6 is COMPLETE.

**(f) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst is bookkeeping-only: it persists both pass-8 and
pass-9 adversary review files, updates INDEX.md (S-21.25's LOCAL Adversary Reviews section +
Convergence Status + Wave-6-COMPLETE marker), updates STORY-INDEX.md (S-21.25 catalog-row
annotation + version bump), updates this decision-log.md entry, burst-log.md, lessons.md, and
STATE.md. It does NOT touch any BC, VP, ADR, or story BODY content — BC-INDEX v4.88, VP-INDEX
v2.79, and ARCH-INDEX v3.76 are all UNCHANGED this burst. No TDD work is started this burst for
either S-21.19 or S-21.25 despite both having reached convergence.

### Agents

  `dd6ee20` operator-binary-computed) and `adv-s21.25-local-pass-9.md` (CLEAN, streak 3/3
  CONVERGED, 2 LOW deferred, input-hash `e9fc788` operator-binary-computed); INDEX.md S-21.25
  LOCAL Adversary Reviews section gained pass-8 + pass-9 rows + Convergence Status advance (→ 3/3
  CONVERGED, cascade CLOSED) + Wave-6-COMPLETE marker; STORY-INDEX v4.380→v4.381 (S-21.25 catalog
  row gained the D-1066 pass-8+pass-9 clause); this D-1066 decision-log.md entry; burst-log.md
  8-block entry; lessons.md entry (Wave 6 COMPLETE milestone); STATE.md full advance (frontmatter,
  Phase Progress row, Current Phase Steps, Decisions Log, Story Status, `[D-1057]` Blocking Issue
  row, trajectory-tail append, Session Resume Checkpoint). Single atomic commit to
  `factory-artifacts` per TD-VSDD-053.

`v1.0-brownfield-backfill` — `decision-log.md`, `burst-log.md`, `lessons.md` — had grown to 21,539 /
29,806 / 11,330 lines respectively (spanning the entire brownfield-onboarding history, D-001
through D-1056/equivalent). These three files were section-aware split at the **D-1057 boundary**:
everything from D-1057 forward (the current S-21.11-split cascade / Wave 6-7 in-flight work) was
**kept active**; everything before D-1057 (completed epics E-17..E-20, early E-21, S-15.x
maintenance history) was **moved verbatim** to three new archive files:
- `decision-log-archive-through-D1056.md` (19,990 lines)
- `burst-log-archive-through-D1056.md` (29,201 lines)
- `lessons-archive-pre-D1057.md` (11,165 lines)

Resulting active-file sizes: `decision-log.md` 21,539→1,557; `burst-log.md` 29,806→613;
`lessons.md` 11,330→173. The split was **section-aware** (by `## D-NNN` heading boundary for
decision-log/burst-log; by top-level heading boundary for lessons.md), not a blind line-count
truncation.

**(b) Byte-conservation proof (re-verified independently this burst, literal shell, D-449(a)).**
Heading-count conservation across active+archive, for all three files:

```
$ grep -c '^## D-' cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/decision-log.md
10
$ grep -c '^## D-' cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/decision-log-archive-through-D1056.md
404
(10 + 404 = 414 -- matches the split's own "414 headings conserved" claim)

$ grep -c '^## D-' cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/burst-log.md
4
$ grep -c '^## D-' cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/burst-log-archive-through-D1056.md
308
(4 + 308 = 312 -- matches the split's own "312 headings conserved" claim)

$ grep -c '^## ' cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/lessons.md
4
$ grep -c '^## ' cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/lessons-archive-pre-D1057.md
338
(4 + 338 = 342 -- matches the split's own "342 headings conserved" claim)
```

All three active-file D-NNN-heading ranges independently confirmed to start at **D-1057** and run
through **D-1066** (10 headings: D-1057..D-1066) in `decision-log.md`; the archive file's highest
heading is **D-1056**. Zero overlap, zero gap, zero loss — the split boundary is exactly where the
commit message claims it is.

**(c) Root cause this fixes.** The 20,000-30,000-line active logs caused the WASM-sandboxed
PostToolUse validators to fuel-exhaust on every Edit/Write/MultiEdit against them (per the
`DEFAULT_FUEL_CAP` ceiling documented in CLAUDE.md's Factory Hook Diagnostics table), which in turn
made every state-manager burst touching these files run to roughly 40 minutes of wall-clock time.
This directly caused **six consecutive D-1066 seal-burst dispatch attempts to die to "API
connection lost mid-response" before any commit landed** — D-1066 was ultimately only landed via a
fourth-attempt direct commit of the completed-but-uncommitted work (see the D-1066 entry above,
"fourth dispatch attempt"). This trim is the overdue **S-15.03 PRIORITY-A** cycle-log-bloat
remediation: keeping only the current cascade's D-NNN range active (roughly 10 headings / ~600-1600
lines per file at any time) keeps every future burst's file-touch well under the WASM fuel budget.

**(d) Drift-item closures.** This trim RESOLVES two previously-OPEN STATE.md Drift Items:
- **`[D-954]` `decision-log.md` >18,000 lines — WASM validators time out on every edit**: RESOLVED.
  Active `decision-log.md` is now 1,557 lines (was 21,539); full history preserved verbatim in
  `decision-log-archive-through-D1056.md`.
- **`[D-442(e)]` `lessons.md` size budget ≤3,500 soft / ≤4,000 hard — was 11,330 lines**: RESOLVED.
  Active `lessons.md` is now 173 lines (well under budget); full history preserved verbatim in
  `lessons-archive-pre-D1057.md`.

Section-aware archival (keep-current-cascade-active, move-completed-history-to-a-named-archive-file
at a named D-NNN cutoff boundary) is established as the going-forward remediation pattern for this
class of drift item — anchored **S-15.03 PRIORITY-A** for automation of the trim trigger (see
`lessons.md` entry this burst).

**(e) Scope boundary (explicit).** This burst is bookkeeping-only: it records the already-committed
`2b287dfe` split in decision-log.md (this entry), burst-log.md, lessons.md, and STATE.md (Historical
Content pointers, Decisions Log row, Current Phase Steps row, Drift Items closures, banner/version
advance). It does **NOT** touch any BC, VP, ADR, or story BODY content, and it does **NOT** touch
the Wave-6-COMPLETE / Wave-7-next substantive pipeline state (Phase Progress, Story Status, Session
Resume Checkpoint) — that state is unchanged and out of scope for this orthogonal maintenance
action. BC-INDEX, VP-INDEX, ARCH-INDEX, STORY-INDEX all UNCHANGED this burst.

## D-1073: WAVE7-PASS3-SESSION-WRAP

D-1073-WAVE7-PASS3-SESSION-WRAP (state-manager, 2026-08-22; single-commit pause burst, TD-VSDD-053, Single-Commit Burst Protocol via `/vsdd-factory:state-burst`, human-invoked `/wrap`; parent `8ef46b8a`/D-1072): **Wave-7 pass-3/R2 fresh-context adversary round dispatched** against S-21.19 (R2, its second remediation round since the D-1070 reopen) and S-21.20/S-21.21/S-21.22/S-21.23 (pass-3), against the D-1072-landed v1.21/v1.3 spec state.

**Pass outcomes:**

**S-21.19 R2 CLEAN** — first clean pass since the D-1070 Task-6 reopen; BC-5.39.001 LOCAL streak **ADVANCES 0/3→1/3**; R1's HIGH (F-S2119-R1-001, ADR-side, closed D-1071) and 2 LOW hygiene items (closed D-1072) independently re-verified resolved and stable; no new findings.

**S-21.20 P3 NOT-CLEAN** — 1 MEDIUM F-S2120-P3-001 (the STORY-INDEX catalog row for S-21.20 still cites `BC-1.03.017 v1.19`, stale by two version bumps; the story's own frontmatter + body cites are current at v1.21 — an index-propagation-class finding, not a story-body defect); LOCAL streak **REMAINS 1/3** (non-resetting).

**S-21.21 P3 NOT-CLEAN** — 1 HIGH F-S2121-P3-001 (the v1.1/v1.2 Addendum's literal-replacement wording for the wave-7 error-exit wiring step would have S-21.21 REPLACE the retained 2-arg `plugin_fail_closed` call with `plugin_fail_closed_on_error_exit`, opening a fail-open window: the retained call is the ONLY live disjunct that re-catches `Timeout` via `.failure_policy` until S-21.24's wave-8 wiring lands, so a literal replacement at wave 7 strips `Timeout` coverage for one full wave with no disjunct catching it) + 1 MEDIUM F-S2121-P3-002 (the story's EC-011 edge-case narrative implies `Timeout{Epoch}` is unenforced today, when in fact it IS enforced today via the existing 2-arg call — only the migration-window framing was wrong); LOCAL streak **REMAINS 0/3**.

**S-21.22 P3 NOT-CLEAN** — 1 MEDIUM F-S2122-P3-001 (BC-1.03.017's Precondition 6 conflated the one-time live-corpus calibration confirmation with the durable standing CI regression assertion; the story's own converged Task 5a already correctly scopes the standing gate to a FROZEN corpus snapshot, but the BC cited a different, live-growing-file mechanism — a BC-side divergence, not a story defect); LOCAL streak **REMAINS 0/3**.

**S-21.23 P3 NOT-CLEAN** — 1 HIGH F-S2123-P3-001 (no test proved the `all`-wildcard's scope-restriction guarantee preserves a NON-named blocking plugin's fail-closed enforcement — a naive suppress-every-block implementation would silently fail open for non-named plugins under `all`, a compound CWE-636+CWE-863 hazard with no audit trail) + 1 MEDIUM F-S2123-P3-002 (S-21.23's own AC-022 hardened PC9 with a 7th COMMENT-ONLY control and a detector-precision requirement that BC-1.03.018's PC9 did not carry — a story-superset-of-BC drift); LOCAL streak **REMAINS 0/3**.

**Codified fixes** (architect + product-owner): `ADR-044 v1.2→v1.3` (Addendum corrected — the wave-7 error-exit wiring step is now ADDITIVE: S-21.21 RETAINS the existing 2-arg `plugin_fail_closed` call and ADDS `plugin_fail_closed_on_error_exit` alongside it, OR-combined, NOT a replacement; S-21.24's wave-8 step gains a MIGRATION sub-task — in the SAME commit that adds `plugin_fail_closed_on_exhaustion`, REMOVE the now-redundant retained 2-arg call; new Invariant: at every commit from S-21.19's merge through S-21.24's merge, the live block-decision call site blocks `Timeout` under `on_error=Block` via SOME disjunct; closes F-S2121-P3-001). `BC-1.03.017 v1.21→v1.22` (Precondition 6 split explicitly into (i) the one-time live-corpus calibration confirmation, which MAY reference live files at calibration time, and (ii) the durable standing gate, which MUST run against the frozen snapshot — matching S-21.22's converged mechanism, closing F-S2122-P3-001; new Invariant 12 migration coverage-continuity, mirroring ADR-044 v1.3's new invariant, closing F-S2121-P3-001; H1 title re-enriched per POLICY 7). `BC-1.03.018 v1.3→v1.4` (PC8 extended to state explicitly that `all` is name-scoped shorthand for the two named gates ONLY, NOT a blanket suppress-every-block switch — a non-named blocking plugin's block MUST stand and MUST NOT receive a `break_glass.activated` record; new Canonical Test Vector row, closing F-S2123-P3-001; PC9 gains an explicit detector-precision requirement (executable-code read pattern, not bare-grep) + control (g) COMMENT-ONLY, control count six→seven matching S-21.23's actual coverage, closing F-S2123-P3-002; H1 title re-enriched per POLICY 7). ARCH-INDEX v3.78→v3.79; BC-INDEX v4.90→v4.91; VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED; STORY-INDEX v4.384 UNCHANGED.

**Story-layer application explicitly NOT STARTED this burst** — the human-invoked `/wrap` pause boundary lands between the spec-layer commit and what would otherwise be the second, distinctly-themed 'story-remediation' commit (mirroring the D-1071/D-1072 and D-1069/D-1070 two-commit precedent), NOT a scope omission. Story-layer fixes pending resume: S-21.20 STORY-INDEX title-cite, S-21.21 Task 5a ADDITIVE-wiring rewrite + EC-011, S-21.22 re-anchor, S-21.23 new negative-control AC + AC-022 count, and full BC-1.03.017 v1.22/BC-1.03.018 v1.4 re-anchor sweep across all six wave-7-adjacent stories.

Compact pass-3 review record persisted: `cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-wave7-pass3.md`. Pipeline **ACTIVE→PAUSED** at a clean pushed HEAD. Session Resume Checkpoint fully replaced (self-sufficient §1-§7); prior D-1072 checkpoint archived verbatim to `session-checkpoints.md`.

Summary: Wave-7 pass-3/R2 fresh-context adversary round; S-21.19 R2 CLEAN (streak 1/3); S-21.20/21/22/23 pass-3 NOT-CLEAN; ADR-044 v1.3 / BC-1.03.017 v1.22 / BC-1.03.018 v1.4 spec-layer fixes LANDED; story-layer application NOT STARTED, pending resume; pipeline ACTIVE→PAUSED (human-invoked `/wrap`).

**Pass-4/R3 outcomes (from adv-wave7-pass4.md):**

**S-21.19 R3 NOT-CLEAN** — 3 HIGH streak-resetting findings: F-S2119-R3-001 (story frames 2-arg `plugin_fail_closed` as "retired"/superseded, contradicting ADR-044 v1.3 ADDITIVE-then-migrate); F-S2119-R3-002 (BC-1.03.017 v1.22 re-anchor missing, 57 sites); F-S2119-R3-003 (ADR-044 v1.1/v1.2→v1.3 stale cite). S-21.19 was OMITTED from D-1074's re-anchor sweep. Streak: 1/3 (from pass-3/R2 CLEAN) → **RESET 0/3**.

**S-21.20 pass-4 NOT-CLEAN** — F-S2120-P4-001 MED (BC-table Title cell "and" insertion breaks POLICY-7 verbatim-subset). Streak: 1/3 → **RESET 0/3**.

**S-21.21 pass-4 NOT-CLEAN** — F-S2121-P4-001 HIGH (BC-1.03.017 v1.22 EC-011 clause asserts no `on_error=Block` enforcement in BOTH sub-cases, contradicting Invariant 12) + F-S2121-P4-002 MED (PC6 S-21.22-ownership not propagated to story Task 10). Streak: **REMAINS 0/3**.

**S-21.22 pass-4 CLEAN** — F-S2122-P4-001 LOW (STOP-gate ceil() vs BC un-ceil'd; NON-RESETTING) + F-S2122-P4-002 LOW (mixed ADR-044 v1.1/v1.3 cite; NON-RESETTING). Streak: **ADVANCES 0/3→1/3**. (Streak-neutral for state purposes: LOWs do not reset.)

**S-21.23 pass-4 NOT-CLEAN** — F-S2123-P4-001 MED (BC-1.03.018 PC9 vs story AC-022 control-letter drift: BC (g)=COMMENT-ONLY vs story (g)=LIVE-TREE) + F-S2123-P4-002 MED (PC9 detector false-green: commented-out full call passes substring detector) + F-S2123-P4-003 MED (stale ADR-044 v1.2 cite). Streak: **REMAINS 0/3**.

**Spec-layer fixes (product-owner, step ①):**

(F-S2122-P4-001 LOW) ceil() adopted throughout all live predicate occurrences. (F-S2121-P4-002 MED) PC6 S-21.22 ownership explicit. H1 enriched per POLICY 7.

`BC-1.03.018 v1.4→v1.5` — (F-S2123-P4-001 MED) PC9 control-letter corrected: (f)=COMMENT-ONLY, (g)=LIVE-TREE. (F-S2123-P4-002 MED) Comment-stripping mandated before executable-code pattern check, closes CWE-636 full-call-in-comment false-green. (F-S2123-P4-005 LOW) PC3 `all` explicit as trimmed-comma-token. H1 enriched per POLICY 7.

**Story-layer fixes (story-writer, step ②):**

STORY-INDEX v4.385→v4.386: all 6 story rows updated (header BC-anchor + input-hash + D-1075 version-chain entry). input-hash recomputed via `compute-input-hash --update`: S-21.19 `915ec83→3eba350` (closes F-S2119-R3-004 MED); decomposition-plan `b89fe92→e89dac3`.

VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (BC VP-TBD deferral is POLICY-9-sanctioned; touched VP-TBD placeholder bodies do NOT trigger VP-INDEX/architect propagation). ARCH-INDEX v3.79 UNCHANGED (no ADR touched this burst; ADR-044 body-cite re-target to v1.23 remains OWED to architect per the existing Drift Item at [D-1064]).

STATE.md advance: v8.58→v8.59 (Decisions Log D-1075 row; Phase Progress row; Story Status; Concurrent Cycles; frontmatter; Session Resume Checkpoint → "pass-5/R4 dispatch NEXT"; trajectory-tail UNCHANGED — streaks UNCHANGED by remediation).

Compact pass-4/R3 review record persisted: `cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-wave7-pass4.md`. Pipeline PAUSED. Session Resume Checkpoint updated to point at pass-5/R4 as NEXT.

Summary: Wave-7 pass-4/R3 remediation burst COMPLETE; BC-1.03.017 v1.23 + BC-1.03.018 v1.5; all 6 wave-7 stories re-anchored; STORY-INDEX v4.386, BC-INDEX v4.92; pass-5/R4 dispatch NEXT (5 independent fresh-context cascades).

**Pass-5/R4 outcomes (from adv-wave7-pass5.md):**

**S-21.19 R4 NOT-CLEAN** — F-S2119-R4-001 HIGH (decomposition-plan §8.7 literal-replacement framing contradicts ADR-044 v1.3 ADDITIVE-then-migrate invariant) + F-S2119-R4-002 LOW non-resetting (ADR-044 v1.3 cite pairing lacks ADDITIVE context anchor). Streak: **REMAINS 0/3**.

**S-21.20 pass-5 CLEAN** — 2 LOW non-resetting findings folded (title-cell ceil() abbreviation; ADR-044 v1.2 historical descriptor). Streak: **ADVANCES 0/3→1/3**.

**S-21.21 pass-5 NOT-CLEAN** — F-S2121-P5-001 HIGH (BC-1.03.017 v1.23 PC6 calibration-ownership over-reach: asserts S-21.22 owns ALL six validator calibration checks; architecturally impossible — S-21.21 owns the five bash-adapter-plugin checks) + F-S2121-P5-002 MED (ceil() Task 11 sibling sweep miss; TD-VSDD-060) + F-S2121-P5-003 LOW non-resetting (title-cell, folded). Streak: **REMAINS 0/3**.

**S-21.22 pass-5 NOT-CLEAN** — F-S2122-P5-001 MED (Token Budget ADR-044 v1.1 stale cite; POLICY 19) + F-S2122-P5-002 MED (title-cell ceil() sibling-sweep miss; TD-VSDD-060). Streak: **RESETS 1/3→0/3**.

**S-21.23 pass-5 NOT-CLEAN** — F-S2123-P5-001 HIGH (AC-022 control-letter (e)/(f) misaligned to BC-1.03.018 v1.5 PC9 seven-partition; (f)=COMMENT-ONLY, (g)=LIVE-TREE; story was at old (f)=LIVE-TREE position, missing new (g); CWE-636 fixture failure). Streak: **REMAINS 0/3**.

All five NOT-CLEAN findings are TD-VSDD-059/060 recurrence-class partial-fix/sibling-sweep gaps from the pass-4 remediation. No new codification needed — already-codified pattern.

**Decomposition-plan fixes (architect, step ①):**

`S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md §8.7→v1.3` — Rewritten to ADR-044 v1.3 ADDITIVE-then-migrate: S-21.21 RETAINS the existing 2-arg `plugin_fail_closed` call AND ADDS `plugin_fail_closed_on_error_exit` alongside it (OR-combined), NOT a literal replacement; closes F-S2119-R4-001 HIGH. New `§8.8 Calibration-Ownership Matrix` added: S-21.21 OWNS BOTH calibration checks (one-time confirmation Tasks #6–#15, after AMD-002 wiring fix GREEN, AND durable CI gate Task 5a frozen `pc6-sufficiency-snapshot/`) for the FIVE legacy-bash-adapter.wasm-hosted plugins; S-21.22 OWNS BOTH checks (Tasks #1–#5 one-time confirmation AND Task 5a frozen snapshot durable CI gate) for the ONE native-WASM plugin `validate-cross-site-correspondence` ONLY. Rationale: per-story ownership preserves wave-7 parallelism (no `depends_on` edge between S-21.21 and S-21.22); routing S-21.21's five-plugin sufficiency gates to S-21.22 would create a false sequential DAG dependency and inflate S-21.22's scope beyond its native-WASM-only mandate. input-hash `e89dac3→d77241f` (compute-input-hash --update executed).

**Spec-layer fixes (product-owner, step ②):**

`BC-1.03.017 v1.23→v1.24` — (F-S2121-P5-001 HIGH) PC6 calibration-ownership over-reach corrected to split-ownership matrix per §8.8: S-21.21 OWNS BOTH checks — one-time calibration confirmation (Tasks #6–#15, after AMD-002 wiring fix GREEN) and durable CI gate (Task 5a frozen `pc6-sufficiency-snapshot/`) — for the FIVE bash-adapter plugins; S-21.22 OWNS BOTH checks — one-time confirmation (Tasks #1–#5) and durable CI gate (Task 5a frozen snapshot) — for `validate-cross-site-correspondence` ONLY. Per-story split ownership preserves wave-7 parallelism. H1 enriched per POLICY 7 to reflect split ownership. Sibling sweep (TD-VSDD-060): only PC6 and H1 carried the over-reach claim; Architecture Anchors, Canonical Test Vectors, VP Anchors, Verification Properties, Traceability, and historical records verified free of this assertion. input-hash 1c300e8 (ADR-044↔BC-1.03.017 circular-inputs cascade resettled at (ADR-044 v1.3, BC-1.03.017 v1.24) snapshot per existing Drift Item; underlying design defect NOT resolved — anchored to future architect touch).

**Story-layer fixes (story-writer, step ③):**

S-21.19 v1.6→v1.7: F-S2119-R4-001 ADR-044 v1.3 ADDITIVE context anchor added to Task 5a cite + F-S2119-R4-002 LOW cite pairing. BC-1.03.017 v1.23→v1.24 re-anchor. input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350.

S-21.20 v1.5→v1.6: 2 LOW folded (title-cell ceil() abbreviation, ADR-044 v1.2 historical descriptor). BC-1.03.017 v1.23→v1.24 re-anchor. input-hash UNCHANGED 33ca0c4.

S-21.21 v1.5→v1.6: F-S2121-P5-001 HIGH PC6 calibration-ownership task framing corrected to §8.8 split-ownership (S-21.21 owns five bash-adapter plugins' checks, S-21.22 owns native-WASM check only) + F-S2121-P5-002 MED ceil() Task 11 + F-S2121-P5-003 LOW title-cell folded. BC-1.03.017 v1.23→v1.24 re-anchor. input-hash UNCHANGED 1e3efaa.

S-21.22 v1.5→v1.6: F-S2122-P5-001 MED ADR-044 v1.1→v1.3 Token Budget cite + F-S2122-P5-002 MED title-cell ceil(). BC-1.03.017 v1.23→v1.24 re-anchor. input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350.

S-21.23 v1.4→v1.5: F-S2123-P5-001 HIGH AC-022 control-letter corrected to (f)=COMMENT-ONLY, (g)=LIVE-TREE per BC-1.03.018 v1.5 PC9 seven-partition. BC-1.03.018 v1.5 BC-anchor UNCHANGED. input-hash UNCHANGED 33ca0c4.

S-21.24 v1.6→v1.7: BC-1.03.017 v1.23→v1.24 re-anchor only. No pass-5 adversary result (own cascade STRICTLY LAST, Wave 7 not yet converged). input-hash UNCHANGED c6a5c6a.

**State-manager index work (this step ④):**

BC-INDEX v4.92→v4.93: BC-1.03.017 v1.24 row-sweep (Title cell re-enriched per POLICY 7: PC6 split-ownership per §8.8 replaces v1.23 over-reach claim; v1.24 version chain entry; closes F-S2121-P5-001 HIGH per POLICY 7/8). BC-1.03.018 row UNCHANGED (v1.5 no new version this burst). total_bcs UNCHANGED 1987.

STORY-INDEX v4.386→v4.387: all 6 story rows updated (BC-anchor v1.23→v1.24 for BC-1.03.017 stories; S-21.20 title-cell BC version cite updated; D-1076 version chain entries). input-hash: decomposition-plan `e89dac3→d77241f` (compute-input-hash --update confirmed); story files all UNCHANGED.

VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (no VP-touching change this burst; VP-TBD deferral POLICY-9-sanctioned). ARCH-INDEX v3.79 UNCHANGED (no ADR touched this burst; ADR-044 body-cite re-target to v1.24 OWED to architect per existing Drift Item [D-1064]).

STATE.md advance: v8.59→v8.60 (D-1076 Decisions Log row; Phase Progress row; Story Status; Concurrent Cycles trajectory-tail →1→0→1→1, LENGTH=4; frontmatter; Session Resume Checkpoint → "pass-6/R5 dispatch NEXT (5 fresh cascades against v1.24/v1.5)"). trajectory-tail updated: pass-5 S-21.20 CLEAN +1, S-21.22 RESET -1, net = →1→0→1→1 LENGTH=4.

adv-wave7-pass5.md persisted: `cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-wave7-pass5.md`. Pipeline PAUSED. Session Resume Checkpoint updated to point at pass-6/R5 as NEXT.

Summary: Wave-7 pass-5/R4 remediation burst COMPLETE; decomposition-plan §8.7+§8.8 (architect); BC-1.03.017 v1.24 split-ownership (product-owner); S-21.19 v1.7/S-21.20 v1.6/S-21.21 v1.6/S-21.22 v1.6/S-21.23 v1.5/S-21.24 v1.7 re-anchored (story-writer); BC-INDEX v4.93, STORY-INDEX v4.387; pass-6/R5 dispatch NEXT (5 independent fresh-context cascades).

## D-1077: WAVE7-FLOOR-BREAK-CONSISTENCY-REMEDIATION

D-1077-WAVE7-FLOOR-BREAK-CONSISTENCY-REMEDIATION (state-manager, 2026-08-24; four-role burst per TD-VSDD-053 — architect step ①, product-owner step ②, story-writer step ③, state-manager step ④ committed as ONE atomic commit; parent D-1076 `0dec5acd`): **Wave-7 floor-breaking full-perimeter consistency-validator audit + remediation burst** triggered by a D-1076 HEAD full-perimeter re-run that localized all residue to S-21.21 and S-21.22 after confirming 7/10 audit classes clean and 4/6 stories residue-free.

**Full-perimeter audit outcome (D-1076 HEAD consistency-validator pass):**

7/10 audit classes clean. 4/6 stories residue-free (S-21.19, S-21.20, S-21.23, S-21.24 — only S-21.24 is a re-anchor-only target). Residue localized to S-21.21 and S-21.22.

**Findings C-W7-001..C-W7-005 (all remediated this burst):**

**C-W7-001 HIGH (S-21.22 AC-007 body description):** `fuel_consumed × 1.5` missing `ceil()` wrapper — "asserts `fuel_consumed × 1.5 <= registry fuel_cap`" should be "asserts `ceil(fuel_consumed × 1.5) <= registry fuel_cap`". TD-VSDD-060 sibling-sweep miss from pass-5/R4 burst.

**C-W7-002 HIGH (S-21.22 AC-007 Test bullet):** `fuel_consumed × 1.5 <= registry fuel_cap` missing `ceil()` — same class as C-W7-001.

**C-W7-003 HIGH (S-21.22 Task 4 regression assertion + Task 5a standing-gate assertion):** Two further body occurrences of `fuel_consumed × 1.5 <=` missing `ceil()`. Full TD-VSDD-060 sweep: four occurrences total (AC-007 body, AC-007 Test bullet, Task 4, Task 5a); no fifth occurrence confirmed.

**C-W7-004 HIGH (S-21.21 Task 10a — durable gate task missing):** S-21.21 had no dedicated durable standing CI gate task for its bash-adapter plugins. Per §8.8 S-21.21 owns BOTH the one-time confirmation (Tasks #6–#15) AND the durable CI frozen-corpus gate — but only Task 10 (one-time confirm) existed; no Task 10a. The gap means the durable gate for the five bash-adapter plugins was architecturally unanchored. Resolution: added Task 10a — `test_bash_adapter_plugins_fuel_cap_sufficiency()` committing `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/` and asserting `ceil(fuel_consumed × 1.5) <= registry fuel_cap` per plugin against FROZEN corpus; placed between Task 10 and Task 11.

**C-W7-005 HIGH (S-21.21 FSR — missing `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/` entry):** File Structure Requirements had no entry for the new dedicated directory or test file introduced by C-W7-004. Resolution: FSR entry added for `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/` and `bash_adapter_fuel_cap_sufficiency.rs`.

**C-W7-006 (ADR-044 v1.18 body cite) DEFERRED:** Remains deferred per D-1064 — fix at architect's next ADR-044 touch (existing Drift Item).

**Spec-layer fixes (product-owner, step ②):**

`BC-1.03.017 v1.24→v1.25` — C-W7-004/005 HIGH: Precondition 6 description updated to reflect adapter-class-specific FROZEN corpus snapshots (not a single shared `pc6-sufficiency-snapshot/`); S-21.21's durable gate path renamed `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/` (dedicated directory per §8.8 calibration-ownership); H1 enriched per POLICY 7 to reflect dedicated path. VP-TBD two-snapshot split noted (Phase-6 formal-verifier anchor, POLICY-9-sanctioned). ADR-044↔BC-1.03.017 cascade resettled at (ADR-044 v1.3, BC-1.03.017 v1.25) snapshot — underlying circular-dependency design defect NOT resolved (existing Drift Item [D-1070/D-1076]). input-hash 1c300e8 (BC's own inputs ADR-039/ADR-042/ADR-044/research unchanged; hash stable).

**Decomposition-plan fixes (architect, step ①):**

`S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md §8.8` — Updated to use dedicated `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/` path for S-21.21's durable gate (closes C-W7-004/005 architectural anchor). Description stabilized to match BC-1.03.017 v1.25 language. input-hash `234548c→6757383` (compute-input-hash --update executed; BC-1.03.017 v1.25 now in inputs).

**Story-layer fixes (story-writer, step ③):**

S-21.19 v1.7→v1.8: BC-1.03.017 v1.24→v1.25 re-anchor only. input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350.

S-21.20 v1.6→v1.7: BC-1.03.017 v1.24→v1.25 re-anchor (frontmatter, H1, Narrative, Context/Finding Summary, all 18 AC-024–AC-041 headers, BC table version, Token Budget, Architecture Compliance Rules). input-hash UNCHANGED 33ca0c4.

S-21.21 v1.6→v1.7: C-W7-004 HIGH Task 10a added (bash-adapter durable frozen-corpus CI gate, `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/`) + C-W7-005 HIGH FSR entry for new directory and test file + BC-1.03.017 v1.24→v1.25 re-anchor. input-hash UNCHANGED 1e3efaa.

S-21.22 v1.6→v1.7: C-W7-001/002/003 HIGH ceil() wrapper added to four body occurrences (AC-007 body, AC-007 Test bullet, Task 4, Task 5a) per TD-VSDD-060 exhaustive sibling sweep + BC-1.03.017 v1.24→v1.25 re-anchor. input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350.

S-21.23 UNCHANGED (v1.5) — residue-free; no touch this burst.

S-21.24 v1.7→v1.8: BC-1.03.017 v1.24→v1.25 re-anchor only. input-hash UNCHANGED c6a5c6a.

**State-manager index work (this step ④):**

BC-INDEX v4.93→v4.94: BC-1.03.017 v1.25 row-sweep (Title cell re-enriched per POLICY 7: dedicated `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/` path for S-21.21's durable gate, adapter-class-specific snapshot language; v1.25 version chain entry; closes C-W7-004/005 HIGH per POLICY 7/8). BC-1.03.018 row UNCHANGED (v1.5). total_bcs UNCHANGED 1987.

STORY-INDEX v4.387→v4.388: 5 story rows updated (BC-anchor v1.24→v1.25; S-21.20 title-cell v1.24→v1.25; D-1077 version chain entries). S-21.23 UNCHANGED. input-hash: decomposition-plan `234548c→6757383` (compute-input-hash --update confirmed); story files all hash-current (no BC in their inputs lists, re-verified).

VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (VP-TBD deferral POLICY-9-sanctioned; no VP-touching change this burst). ARCH-INDEX v3.79 UNCHANGED (no ADR touched this burst; ADR-044 body-cite re-target to v1.25 OWED to architect per existing Drift Item [D-1064]).

STATE.md advance: v8.60→v8.61 (D-1077 Decisions Log row; Phase Progress row; Story Status; Concurrent Cycles UNCHANGED trajectory-tail; frontmatter; Session Resume Checkpoint → pass-6/R5 NEXT against v1.25/v1.5). Streaks UNCHANGED by remediation: S-21.20 1/3; S-21.19/21/22/23 all 0/3.

Summary: Wave-7 floor-break consistency remediation COMPLETE; decomp-plan §8.8 `pc6-bash-adapter-sufficiency-snapshot/` (architect); BC-1.03.017 v1.25 dedicated-path (product-owner); S-21.19 v1.8/S-21.20 v1.7/S-21.21 v1.7/S-21.22 v1.7/S-21.24 v1.8 re-anchored (story-writer); BC-INDEX v4.94, STORY-INDEX v4.388; pass-6/R5 dispatch NEXT (5 fresh cascades against v1.25/v1.5).

## D-1078: WAVE7-PASS6-R5-STORY-REMEDIATION

D-1078-WAVE7-PASS6-R5-STORY-REMEDIATION (state-manager, 2026-08-24; four-role burst per TD-VSDD-053 — architect step ①, product-owner step ②, story-writer step ③, state-manager step ④ committed as ONE atomic commit; parent D-1077 `daecbbdb`): **Wave-7 pass-6/R5 adversarial review + remediation burst**. Floor-break audit (D-1077) confirmed effective — all OLD residue classes clean at pass-6 (consistency-validator confirmed zero residue from the D-1077 full-perimeter sweep). Five new novel, decaying-severity findings (TD-VSDD-059/060 recurrence-class; no new codification).

**Pass-6/R5 adversarial review outcomes:**

S-21.20 (pass-6) CLEAN — 2 LOW non-resetting (F-S2120-P6-001: ADR-044 missing from inputs:; F-S2120-P6-002: DAG label editorial, deferred). Streak ADVANCES 1/3→2/3.

S-21.21 (pass-6) NOT-CLEAN — F-S2121-P6-001 HIGH: Task 10a ordering hazard — flip-conditional guard missing (snapshot committed this session guard required to prevent redundant re-emission). Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.22 (pass-6) NOT-CLEAN — F-S2122-P6-001 MED: Task 4 cite misattributed PC6(ii)→should be PC6(i) (bash-adapter-class regression is PC6(i) not PC6(ii)/native-WASM). Streak REMAINS 0/3.

Full adversary record: `cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/adv-wave7-pass6.md`.

**Spec-layer fixes (product-owner, step ②):**

`BC-1.03.018 v1.5→v1.6` — F-S2123-P6-002 LOW POLICY-19: ADR-version-pin `v1.10` stripped from PC9 `§Decision 3` cite → `§Decision 3 minimum-viable definition`; F-S2123-P6-003 LOW: `std::env::var_os`-exclusive detector-precision examples + accessor-agnostic clarification sentence added. H1 enriched per POLICY 7. input-hash cascade settled: `1b1c570→3bf2a93` (BC-1.03.017 v1.25 stable; ADR-044↔BC-1.03.017 circular-dependency Drift Item re-settled at (ADR-044 v1.3, BC-1.03.017 v1.25) snapshot).

**Decomposition-plan fixes (architect, step ①):**

`S-21.11-decomposition-plan.md §8.8` — Task-10a flip-conditional addendum: guard clause added (only emit durable gate if snapshot committed this session). §S-21.23 descriptor updated to reference `std::env::var_os`-exclusive detector precision per BC-1.03.018 v1.6. S-21.24 PC1–PC12 / 47-AC descriptor fixes applied. input-hash `a373feb→65d6fa3` (BC-1.03.018 v1.6 + STORY-INDEX v4.389 in inputs).

**Story-layer fixes (story-writer, step ③):**

S-21.19 v1.8→v1.9: F-S2119-R5-001 MED: ADR-044 v1.3→v1.1 split-cite sweep (14 sites; foundational split-topology invariant cites use v1.1; flip-capstone ownership cites retain v1.3). input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350.

S-21.20 UNCHANGED (v1.7) — pass-6 CLEAN, streak ADVANCES 1/3→2/3. Note: F-S2120-P6-001 LOW POLICY-18 frontmatter correction handled by state-manager step ④ (no story version bump).

S-21.21 v1.7→v1.8: F-S2121-P6-001 HIGH: Task 10a conditional preamble added (only emit durable frozen-corpus gate if snapshot committed this session; prevents redundant overwrite on re-runs). input-hash UNCHANGED 1e3efaa.

S-21.22 v1.7→v1.8: F-S2122-P6-001 MED: Task 4 regression-assertion header cite corrected PC6(ii)→PC6(i) (Task 4 bash-adapter-class regression correctly attributed to S-21.21's ownership mandate; S-21.22 owns only PC6(ii)/validate-cross-site-correspondence). input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350.

S-21.23 v1.5→v1.6: F-S2123-P6-001 MED: plan descriptor updated; F-S2123-P6-002/003 LOW: BC-1.03.018 v1.5→v1.6 re-anchor (behavioral_contracts, H1, all body). input-hash UNCHANGED 33ca0c4.

**D-1079-WAVE7-PASS7-R6-STORY-REMEDIATION**

Wave-7 pass-7/R6 adversary cascade (adv-wave7-pass7.md) dispatched against BC-1.03.017 v1.25 / BC-1.03.018 v1.6 / ADR-044 v1.3 / ADR-039 v1.16. Results: S-21.20 pass-7 CLEAN → 3/3 CONVERGED (PROVISIONAL; pass-8 re-confirmation required per BC-1.03.017 v1.26 anchor change; PC6-orthogonal; high confidence CLEAN); S-21.19 (R6), S-21.21 (pass-7), S-21.22 (pass-7), S-21.23 (pass-7) NOT-CLEAN, remediated.

**Spec-layer fixes (product-owner, step ①):**

BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26: F-S2121-P7-001 HIGH: Precondition 6 flip-conditional language added — iterates `failure_policy == fail-closed` plugins only; assertion vacuously GREEN at S-21.21's own merge per decomposition-plan §8.8 Addendum. F-S2121-P7-002 MED + F-S2122-P7-001 MED: ceil() sweep at 4+2 body occurrences — `fuel_consumed × 1.5` wrapped in `ceil(...)` throughout BC body (~L526, ~L562, ~L569, ~L1327-1328 + VP-TBD row + Traceability ADR row). H1 enriched per POLICY 7. BC-INDEX v4.95→v4.96: BC-1.03.017 v1.26 row updated (Title parity; version chain entry; input-hash 1c300e8 UNCHANGED from v1.23–v1.25 since ADR-044 v1.3 declared input unchanged). total_bcs UNCHANGED 1987.

POLICY codifications (policies.yaml v1.4.24→v1.4.25):

- POLICY 19 scope extended from `behavioral-contracts-traceability-rows` to also cover `story-bodies`. Closes F-S2123-P7-P19-001 process-gap: story bodies were accumulating forbidden ADR version pins (e.g., `ADR-039 §Decision 3 v1.10`) that POLICY 19 was intended to prohibit but the prior scope enumeration did not cover.
- POLICY 5 multiline-sweep mandate added: re-anchor sweeps MUST use `tr '\n' ' ' | grep` normalized detector (not per-physical-line grep). Closes F-S2119-R6-001 regression of F-S2119-P3-001: a 14-site D-1078 pass-6/R5 sweep missed the 15th cite because the ADR-044 version token spanned two physical lines and single-line grep cannot cross line boundaries. The multiline-normalized `tr '\n' ' ' | grep -oE 'ADR-[0-9]+[[:space:]]+v[0-9.]+'` detector closes this class.

**Story-layer fixes (story-writer, step ②):**

S-21.19 v1.9→v1.10: F-S2119-R6-001 MED: tr-normalized multiline sweep confirmed zero remaining version-pin cites; F-S2119-R6-002 LOW: ADR sub-version pin stripped (`ADR-044 §Decision 5 v1.3` → `ADR-044 §Decision 5`); story-wide ADR-044 v1.1/v1.3 body-pin-strip (POLICY 19 extended to story-bodies; Changelog entries exempt). BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26 re-anchor. input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.20 v1.7→v1.8: BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26 re-anchor (frontmatter behavioral_contracts, H1, all body); story-wide ADR-pin-strip (POLICY 19). input-hash UNCHANGED c6a5c6a. Streak ADVANCES 2/3→3/3 CONVERGED (PROVISIONAL — pass-8 re-confirmation REQUIRED per BC-1.03.017 v1.26 anchor change; PC6-orthogonal; high confidence CLEAN). Non-resetting observations: F-S2120-P7-001 LOW (re-anchor mechanical/PC6-orthogonal; non-resetting); F-S2120-P7-002 LOW (DAG label `"(REOPENED — ADR-044 v1.2 function-split reconvergence in flight)"` stale editorial; DEFERRED — anchor next S-21.20 touch).

S-21.21 v1.8→v1.9: BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26 re-anchor (frontmatter, H1, all body) + ADR-pin-strip (POLICY 19). input-hash UNCHANGED 1e3efaa. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.22 v1.8→v1.9: F-S2122-P7-001 MED: Task 4 narrative `fuel_consumed × 1.5` → `ceil(fuel_consumed × 1.5)` applied; BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26 re-anchor + ADR-pin-strip (POLICY 19). F-S2122-P7-003 LOW DEFERRED: Task 3 cross-reference to S-21.21 Task 6 stale task number (non-load-bearing; anchor wave-gate pre-merge consistency check). input-hash UNCHANGED 3eba350. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.23 v1.6→v1.7: F-S2123-P7-P19-001 MED: 6-site ADR-039 version-pin strip (`v1.10`/`v1.9` suffixes removed at ~L356/L401/L720/L855/L900/L942; stable form `ADR-039 §Decision 3`; POLICY 19 story-bodies extension); F-S2123-P7-P4-002 MED: provenance correction at 2 sites (§Bidirectional Parity Audit Note corrected from `BC-1.03.018 v1.5` to `BC-1.03.018 v1.4` as ground truth for PC8-scope and seven-control count per BC-1.03.018 Changelog D-1073 entry). BC-1.03.018 UNCHANGED (v1.6). input-hash UNCHANGED 33ca0c4. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.24 v1.9→v1.10: BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26 re-anchor (frontmatter behavioral_contracts, H1, all body) + ADR-pin-strip (POLICY 19). BC-1.03.018 v1.6 UNCHANGED. input-hash UNCHANGED c6a5c6a. Cascade STRICTLY LAST; own pass-8 re-confirmation PENDING.

**State-manager step ③ (this entry):**

adv-wave7-pass7.md persisted (5 verdicts: S-21.20 CLEAN → 3/3 CONVERGED PROVISIONAL; S-21.19/21/22/23 NOT-CLEAN FIXED).

POLICY 19 scope extension (story-bodies) + POLICY 5 multiline-sweep mandate codified in policies.yaml v1.4.25.

BC-INDEX v4.95→v4.96: BC-1.03.017 v1.26 row (Title per POLICY 7; version chain v1.26 entry; input-hash 1c300e8 UNCHANGED). total_bcs UNCHANGED 1987.

STORY-INDEX v4.389→v4.390: 6 story BC-pin header updates (S-21.19/20/21/22: BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26; S-21.23: BC-1.03.018 v1.5→v1.6 carry-forward from D-1078; S-21.24: BC-1.03.017 v1.25→v1.26 + BC-1.03.018 v1.5→v1.6 carry-forward); S-21.20 header input-hash corrected 33ca0c4→c6a5c6a (D-1078 POLICY-18 update not propagated to header); 6 D-1079 row entries appended; blockquote corrections: S-21.19=915ec83→3eba350 (stale from D-1072; catalog had 3eba350 since D-1075), S-21.20=33ca0c4→c6a5c6a (D-1078 non-propagation). ADR-044↔BC-1.03.017 cascade re-settled at (ADR-044 v1.3, BC-1.03.017 v1.26, input-hash 1c300e8 UNCHANGED from v1.23–v1.25).

VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED. ARCH-INDEX v3.79 UNCHANGED.

Drift item RESOLVED: `[D-1078] BC-1.03.017 PC6(ii) ceil vs no-ceil behavioral drift` — ceil() sweep complete at v1.26 (structural fix; no longer inert surface drift). STATE.md Drift Items row updated RESOLVED D-1079.

**D-1080-WAVE7-PASS8-R7-STORY-REMEDIATION**

Wave-7 pass-8/R7 adversary cascade (adv-wave7-pass8.md) dispatched against BC-1.03.017 v1.26 / BC-1.03.018 v1.6 / ADR-044 v1.3 / ADR-039 v1.16. Results: S-21.20 pass-8 NOT-CLEAN (RESET 3/3→0/3 — BC-table-cell miss at v1.25; D-1079 "full propagation" claim unbacked by table-cell-aware gate); S-21.19 (R7), S-21.21 (pass-8), S-21.22 (pass-8), S-21.23 (pass-8) NOT-CLEAN, all remediated.

**Spec-layer fixes (product-owner, step ①):**

BC-1.03.017 v1.26→v1.27: F-S2119-R7-001 MED: BC traceability row monolithic-S-21.11 framing corrected to split-topology split-seam-1 framing per §Architecture Anchors split-ownership section (all live monolithic-S-21.11 cites replaced with split-topology framing referencing the six-story split topology per D-1057). H1 enriched per POLICY 7 (same root-cause: split-topology coverage language added). BC-INDEX v4.96→v4.97: BC-1.03.017 v1.27 row updated (Title parity per POLICY 7; version chain v1.27 entry; input-hash 1c300e8→9b06e6d since BC body text changed). total_bcs UNCHANGED 1987.

POLICY codification (policies.yaml v1.4.25→v1.4.26):

- POLICY 8 TABLE-CELL-AWARE PARITY GATE verification step added: re-anchor bursts claiming "full propagation" MUST run and capture a table-cell-aware grep (`grep -nE '\| *<BC-ID> *\| *v[0-9]'`) to isolate the pipe-delimited BC-table Version column cell BEFORE attesting propagation. A free-text grep that does not isolate the Version column cell is NOT sufficient. An unbacked "full propagation" claim is itself a POLICY 8 finding. Closes BC-table-Version-cell straggler class F-S2120-R7-001/F-S2121-P8-001/F-S2122-P8-001 MED×3. POLICY 8 codified_at set to D-1080.

**Plan fixes (architect, step ①):**

Decomposition-plan §3/§4 AC-042–045 provenance corrected: §3 intro paragraph and §4 recommendation now cite the correct AC-042–045 provenance (AC-042 from S-21.19 AC set, AC-043–045 from S-21.23 AC set per the split-topology seam boundaries at D-1057). Context for F-S2123-P8-002 LOW (stale provenance descriptor referencing pre-D-1080 plan state). input-hash b89fe92→5d030c6.

**Story-layer fixes (story-writer, step ②):**

S-21.19 v1.10→v1.11: F-S2119-R7-001 MED: BC traceability row monolithic-S-21.11 framing corrected (split-seam-1 framing per BC-1.03.017 v1.27 §Architecture Anchors). BC-1.03.017 v1.26→v1.27 re-anchor. input-hash 3eba350→7bab495. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.20 v1.8→v1.9: F-S2120-R7-001 MED: BC table cell corrected v1.25→v1.27 (POLICY 8 straggler — D-1079 claimed "full propagation" but did not run table-cell-aware grep; the pipe-delimited BC-table Version column cell was not reached). BC-1.03.017 v1.26→v1.27 re-anchor. input-hash c6a5c6a→fe80978. Streak RESET 3/3→0/3 per BC-5.39.001 (BC-table-cell miss = genuine POLICY 8 MED finding; streak resets).

S-21.21 v1.9→v1.10: F-S2121-P8-001 MED: BC table cell corrected v1.25→v1.27 (same straggler class as F-S2120-R7-001). F-S2121-P8-002 MED: ADR-pin residual swept — 2 sites: ADR-044 v1.3 context anchor in Task 5a's live-wiring narrative + `§Decision 4 v1.16` in calibration-sufficiency rationale (POLICY 19 story-bodies extension, D-1079). BC-1.03.017 v1.26→v1.27 re-anchor. input-hash 1e3efaa→5a05f4e. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.22 v1.9→v1.10: F-S2122-P8-001 MED: BC table cell corrected v1.25→v1.27 (same straggler class). F-S2122-P8-002 MED: ADR-pin residual swept — 1 site: `ADR-044 §Decision 5 v1.3` in calibration-protocol narrative (POLICY 19). BC-1.03.017 v1.26→v1.27 re-anchor. input-hash 3eba350→431d6ae. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.23 v1.7→v1.8: F-S2123-P8-001 MED: DAG diagram block `ADR-044 v1.3 function-split reconvergence` annotation stripped to stable form `ADR-044 function-split reconvergence` (POLICY 19 story-bodies). F-S2123-P8-002 LOW: decomposition-plan §3/§4 AC-042–045 provenance descriptor updated (architect correction D-1080). BC-1.03.018 UNCHANGED (v1.6). input-hash 33ca0c4→0e718ce. Streak REMAINS 0/3.

S-21.24 v1.10→v1.11: BC-1.03.017 v1.26→v1.27 re-anchor (frontmatter behavioral_contracts, H1, all body; split-topology re-anchor sweep; capstone STRICTLY LAST). BC-1.03.018 v1.6 UNCHANGED. input-hash c6a5c6a→2562802. Own cascade STRICTLY LAST; own pass-9/R8 re-confirmation PENDING.

**Disposition: NOT REMEDIATED.** All pass-9 findings are instances of two root-cause classes: (a) version-pin propagation churn (HIGH finds are structurally invisible to grep-based detectors via line-wrap or anchor interposition); (b) detector-architecture [process-gap] (MED/LOW finds identify tooling blindness, not story defects). Manual remediation would advance BC/ADR versions, regenerating new cohort-wide cites — the structural floor identified across passes 4–9. Pipeline PIVOTED to external research → ADR-045 proposal.

**ADR-045 PROPOSED (stable-anchor cross-reference architecture; architect; 2026-08-24):**

ADR-045 v1.0 proposes three decisions: (1) replace inline `BC vN.NN` / `ADR §Decision N vN.NN` version-pin cites with stable fingerprint anchors (function/invariant name, heading text); (2) introduce an AST-based suspect-link validator (Doorstop fingerprint/suspect-link model) that detects stale cites by document fingerprint comparison rather than version-string grep; (3) establish a corpus-migration epic to retroactively replace all existing version-pin cites. Subsystems: SS-01, SS-04, SS-05, SS-07. Research grounded in `.factory/research/wave7-xref-consistency-research.md`. Status: proposed. HUMAN RATIFICATION REQUIRED via POLICY 22 channel. POLICY 7/8/14/17/19 amendments deferred to ratification burst.

**Wave-7 pre-TDD cascade HELD:** Wave-7 is neither accepted (findings open) nor converged (streaks: S-21.22 1/3; S-21.19/20/21/23 0/3). Cascade HELD pending ADR-045 ratification, which unblocks the validator-build + corpus-migration epic. S-21.22 streak 1/3 and S-21.25 3/3 CONVERGED status are unaffected by the HELD state.

**ARCH-INDEX v3.79→v3.80:**

ADR-045 row appended to ARCH-INDEX after ADR-044 row. ADR count 44→45. ARCH-INDEX version: v3.79→v3.80. Frontmatter last_amended prepended (D-1081 entry). VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED. BC-INDEX v4.97 UNCHANGED. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED.

**STATE.md v8.64→v8.65:** D-1081 Decisions Log row; Phase Progress D-1081 row; Current Phase Steps scroll (D-1076 archived, D-1081 added); Identifier Conventions ADR count 44→45, ARCH-INDEX v3.80; Story Status (S-21.22 streak 0/3→1/3; others UNCHANGED); Blocking Issues ADR-045 HUMAN RATIFICATION GATE added; Drift Items Wave-7 version/ADR-pin propagation tail + 3 [process-gap] detector-completeness items added; trajectory-tail →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4; Active Branches / Concurrent Cycles updated; Session Resume → Wave-7 HELD pending ADR-045 ratification.

Summary: Wave-7 pass-9/R8 RECORDED and HELD. S-21.22 CLEAN (streak 1/3). S-21.19/20/21/23 NOT-CLEAN (all version/ADR-pin class or detector [process-gap]). NOT remediated — pipeline pivoted to ADR-045 stable-anchor architecture proposal. Wave-7 pre-TDD cascade HELD pending human ratification. ARCH-INDEX v3.80 (ADR count 44→45). Streaks: S-21.22 1/3; S-21.19 0/3; S-21.20 0/3; S-21.21 0/3; S-21.23 0/3. NEXT: human ADR-045 ratification decision.

## D-1082

**D-1082-ADR046-PASS25-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1081 (this cycle's decision-log.md; the F5 cycle at `cycles/v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1/decision-log.md`
tops out at D-454, well below). D-1082 is allocated cleanly above the true max. Note the
pre-existing backfill-owed gap: the rc.24 release burst and the full ADR-046 creation history
(passes 1–24, ADR-046 v1.0→v1.10, BC-4.17.001 v1.0→v1.11, BC-7.07.001 v1.19→v1.27, BC-5.40.001
v1.4→v1.9) and the ADR-045 v1.0→v1.3 pivot all occurred between D-1081 (2026-08-24) and this
entry without consuming any D-NNN — that backfill remains OWED (tracked in STATE.md Blocking
Issues) and is unaffected by this allocation.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 25 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.10 + BC-4.17.001 v1.11 + BC-7.07.001 v1.27 + BC-5.40.001 v1.9). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(2), both MEDIUM.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESET 1/3→0/3 (any finding resets; pass-24 was the
sole clean pass banked). Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-25.md` (first persisted per-pass file for
this gate — passes 1–24 were narrative-only in STATE.md/session-checkpoints.md; this establishes
the `adv-adr-046-pass-N.md` convention mirroring `adv-adr-043-pass-N.md`).

**F-P25-001 (MED, POLICY 4 spec-vs-code type/function mismatch) — FIXED.** ADR-046 §Decision 1 /
File-Change Plan and BC-7.07.001 Invariant 3b mis-typed `flp::parse_factory_lock`'s result as
`FactoryLock`; it actually returns `LockState` (crate `factory-lock-parse`) — a field-identical
sibling struct to `FactoryLock` (crate `factory-lock`), which is produced only by the distinct
function `factory_lock::parse_lock`, never called on this path. Canonical model now stated
unambiguously in both artifacts: `renew_lock_if_holder` performs its own independent
`flp::parse_factory_lock(content)` parse at the holder-present step, yielding `LockState`.
This is the escalation of the previously-tracked **O-P24-001 (LOW)** type-provenance nit from
pass-24 — now RESOLVED (moved to closed; no longer an open Drift Item).

**F-P25-002 (MED, traceability story-anchor conflict) — FIXED.** ADR-046 named S-17.05 as the
implementing story in narrative while all three companion BCs still carried `[pending]`
placeholders in Traceability §Stories/§Story Anchor, and ADR-046's own File-Change Plan
cross-reference to S-17.05 did not resolve (S-17.05 absent from the File-Change Plan itself).
Architect added an explicit S-17.05 row to ADR-046's File-Change Plan; product-owner cited S-17.05
in all three BCs' Traceability §Stories rows and §Story Anchor fields. All four frozen-set
artifacts now agree on S-17.05 (`stamp-state-timestamp-hook`, E-17 Wave 5, 8pts,
`tdd_mode: strict`).

**Artifact versions (all edits already on disk before this state-manager burst; reconciled
same-commit):** ADR-046 v1.10→**v1.11**; BC-7.07.001 v1.27→**v1.28**; BC-4.17.001 v1.11→**v1.12**;
BC-5.40.001 v1.9→**v1.10**. Input-hashes recomputed via `bin/compute-input-hash --update`:
ADR-046 `a26e973`; BC-4.17.001 `407e0ff`; BC-5.40.001 `d046d5a`; BC-7.07.001 `fea7819`.
**BC-4.17.001↔BC-7.07.001 mutual `inputs:` cite NON-CONVERGING cyclic-hash cascade (previously
tracked in STATE.md Drift Items) reconfirmed this burst** — 3 successive recompute rounds
ping-ponged (BC-4.17.001: `60822ce`→`db873d5`→`5dd2dc1`→`407e0ff`; BC-7.07.001: `e7017cb`
(stale)→`03b2edd`→`fea7819`→`fea7819` stable-on-3rd-round only because BC-4.17.001 was recomputed
AFTER it) and does not converge to a fixed point by construction (each file's frontmatter
`input-hash` field is itself part of the content the other file's hash is computed over).
**Settled per task instruction ("if it ping-pongs, settle at one computed value and note it — do
not loop forever"):** final order was BC-7.07.001 → BC-4.17.001 → BC-5.40.001; BC-4.17.001's
stored hash (`407e0ff`) is current relative to BC-7.07.001's stored content; BC-7.07.001's stored
hash (`fea7819`) reflects BC-4.17.001's PRIOR content (`5dd2dc1`), one cycle behind — this is the
expected, already-tracked cyclic-TD residue, not a new defect. Not re-opened as a new Drift Item;
cross-referenced against the existing entry (see STATE.md Drift Items).

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst — closes the "Index reconciliation OWED" item
STATE.md has carried since ADR-046's authoring session):**

- **BC-INDEX v4.97→v4.98:** BC-4.17.001 NEW row registered (SS-04, CAP-031, S-17.05, v1.0..v1.12
  — was pending registration since v1.0 authoring 2026-08-25). SS-04 count 43→44. total_bcs
  1987→1988. BC-7.07.001 row Version cell reconciled v1.18→v1.28 (10-version backfill from the
  file's own `modified[]` history — the row had drifted 10 versions stale). BC-7.07.001 row Title
  cell also found stale (pre-identity-gate `renew_lock()` text) — re-synced to current H1 verbatim
  per POLICY 7 (in-scope production-grade fix, discovered during this reconciliation, not part of
  the orchestrator's original scoped instruction but fixed per CANONICAL PRINCIPLE Rule 4).
  BC-5.40.001 row Version cell reconciled v1.3→v1.10 (7-version backfill); Title cell similarly
  re-synced to current H1 verbatim (was pre-ADR-046 text). Both BC-7.07.001 and BC-5.40.001
  Stories cells gained S-17.05.
- **ARCH-INDEX v3.80→v3.81:** ADR-046 row status corrected PROPOSED v1.0/HUMAN-RATIFICATION-
  REQUIRED (stale since 2026-08-25 authoring — the row was never kept version-current across the
  24 spec-convergence passes) → ACCEPTED, v1.11, with a pass-25 remediation summary appended. ADR
  count unchanged at 46 (both ADR-045 and ADR-046 rows already existed in the table; this burst
  corrects ADR-046's stale status/version text only).
- VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED (S-17.05 already file-resident; no
  STORY-INDEX row content changed by this burst).

**O-P24-001 (LOW) — RESOLVED.** Folded into F-P25-001's fix; removed from STATE.md Blocking
Issues / Drift Items as an open item.

**Non-blocking process observation (logged, not a violation):** during this burst's upstream
spec-remediation work, a product-owner agent ran ONE read-only `grep` via Bash (STORY-INDEX
presence check for S-17.05) — no `.factory` mutation via Bash occurred; all content edits used
the Edit tool. Logged for the record, same class as the prior 2026-08-26 pass-21
TD-FACTORY-HOOK-BYPASS-001 deviation note (which WAS a mutation-via-Bash violation); this
occurrence is read-only and therefore not a TD-FACTORY-HOOK-BYPASS-001 instance, but is recorded
to reinforce Edit/Write-only discipline for `.factory` mutations going forward.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→0/3; Current Artifact Versions updated (ADR-046 v1.11,
BC-7.07.001 v1.28, BC-4.17.001 v1.12, BC-5.40.001 v1.10); Blocking Issues ADR-046 gate row updated
(streak 0/3, pass-25 findings fixed) and O-P24-001 removed (resolved); Session Resume Checkpoint
refreshed (§2 Convergence Counter 0/3, fresh pass-26 NEXT; §3 versions; §7 resume command);
Drift Items gains the non-blocking process-observation note above. Trajectory-tail unchanged
(Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-25 COMPLETE. 2 MED findings (F-P25-001 type-provenance,
F-P25-002 traceability) found and fixed same-burst. Streak RESET 1/3→0/3 per literal-3-CLEAN
discipline. Canonical `LockState`-not-`FactoryLock` decision codified. S-17.05 anchor
reconciliation closes the last traceability gap blocking convergence. Index reconciliation debt
(BC-INDEX + ARCH-INDEX, owed since ADR-046's authoring session) CLOSED this burst. Fresh pass-26
is the documented NEXT action; needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1083

**D-1083-ADR046-PASS26-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1082 (this cycle's decision-log.md; the F5 cycle at `cycles/v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1/decision-log.md`
tops out at D-454, well below). D-1083 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 26 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.11 + BC-4.17.001 v1.12 + BC-7.07.001 v1.28 + BC-5.40.001 v1.10). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(1 MED + 2 LOW observations).** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset at pass-25;
this finding does not reset an already-0/3 streak further). Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-26.md`.

**F-P26-001 (MED, POLICY 14/17/6, sibling-instruction-row sweep gap) — FIXED.** ADR-046's
File-Change Plan carries its own self-referential sync instruction row directing the ARCH-INDEX
ADR-046 row's target version. That row had drifted stale: it still directed a bump to "v1.10,"
leading with the pass-21/F-P21-001 disposition, even after the pass-25 architect edit had already
advanced the ADR to v1.11 (and added the File-Change Plan's own new S-17.05 row per F-P25-002) —
the pass-25 edit swept every OTHER locus stating the ADR's content but did not sweep this SIBLING
instruction row, which instructs a downstream artifact rather than describing the ADR's own
content. Architect resolved by rewriting the row to direct the bump to **v1.12** — this revision's
own resulting version — re-leading its summary with the pass-26 (F-P26-001) disposition followed
by the pass-25 (F-P25-001/F-P25-002) disposition, with the pass-21/F-P21-001 text demoted one rung
further down the existing Prior chain (content unchanged, only nesting position). A sweep for
other load-bearing self-version directives found no other locus needing correction. ADR-046
v1.11→**v1.12**.

**O-P26-001 (LOW, non-blocking) — recorded, no fix this burst.** BC-7.07.001 carries
`status: active` while its ADR-046 amendment invariants are not yet implemented (implementing
story S-17.05 has not started — gated on this convergence). Judged WORKING-AS-DESIGNED
spec-leading-code, anchored S-17.05, per this repo's VSDD "spec wins" standing rule — unlike
sibling BC-4.17.001 (wholly draft, no ambiguity), BC-7.07.001 pre-dates ADR-046 and is amended in
place, so `active` correctly describes its implemented pre-ADR-046 baseline plus a not-yet-shipped
spec-ahead amendment layer. No inline pending marker added. Recorded as a non-blocking awareness
note only.

**O-P26-002 (LOW, `[process-gap]`, non-blocking) — recorded, deferred.** ARCH-INDEX's SS-07
subsystem label "Hook Bash Layer" is an increasing misnomer as native-WASM hook plugins (including
the ones ADR-046 itself proposes) continue to accrete under it alongside the bash hook scripts the
label originally described. Predates ADR-046; out of this pass's review perimeter; no frozen-set
artifact introduced or worsened it. Per the S-7.02 cycle-closing checklist, recorded as a Drift
Item anchored to a future ARCH-INDEX subsystem-label review — not this burst's scope, no SS-07
label edit made.

**Artifact versions (architect edit already on disk before this state-manager burst;
reconciled same-commit):** ADR-046 v1.11→**v1.12**. BC-4.17.001/BC-7.07.001/BC-5.40.001
UNCHANGED this burst (no BC touched — F-P26-001 is ADR-046-only). Input-hash recomputed via
`bin/compute-input-hash --update`: ADR-046 `a26e973`→**`26c1c59`**.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **ARCH-INDEX v3.81→v3.82:** ADR-046 row version cite corrected v1.11→v1.12; pass-26 (F-P26-001,
  fixed) + 2 LOW observations (O-P26-001, O-P26-002) summary appended ahead of the existing
  pass-25 summary (pass-25 text preserved verbatim, not truncated). ADR count unchanged at 46 (row
  update only, not a new-row addition).
- BC-INDEX v4.98 UNCHANGED (no BC touched this burst). VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED. STORY-INDEX
  v4.391 UNCHANGED.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset); Current
Artifact Versions ADR-046 v1.11→v1.12; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3,
pass-26 1 MED found+fixed, fresh pass-27 NEXT); Drift Items gains O-P26-002 (`[process-gap]`,
deferred, anchored future ARCH-INDEX subsystem-label review) and a non-blocking awareness note for
O-P26-001; Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 Convergence Counter 0/3 REMAINS, fresh pass-27
NEXT; §3 ADR-046 v1.12; §7 resume command); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for
D-1083 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1079 row archived off,
already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory-tail unchanged (Wave-7 not
touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-26 COMPLETE. 1 MED finding (F-P26-001, sibling-
instruction-row sweep gap — a self-referential version-bump directive inside an ADR's own
File-Change Plan is itself a parity leg) found and fixed same-burst. 2 LOW observations recorded
non-blocking (O-P26-001 awareness note, O-P26-002 deferred process-gap). Streak REMAINS 0/3 (no
further reset — was already 0/3 entering this pass). Fresh pass-27 is the documented NEXT action;
needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1084

**D-1084-ADR046-PASS27-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1083 (this cycle's decision-log.md; the F5 cycle at `cycles/v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1/decision-log.md`
tops out at D-454, well below). D-1084 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 27 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.12 + BC-4.17.001 v1.12 + BC-7.07.001 v1.28 + BC-5.40.001 v1.10). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(3: 1 HIGH + 2 MED) + 1 LOW observation.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset
at pass-25; findings do not reset an already-0/3 streak further). All findings were
S-17.05-retrofit sibling-sweep stragglers of the pass-25 `[pending]`→S-17.05 resolution: passes
25/26 swept the Traceability §Stories rows and prose but not §Story Anchor, status/lifecycle
parity, or `inputs:` completeness. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-27.md`.

**F-P27-001 (HIGH, POLICY 4, §Story Anchor sibling-sweep gap) — FIXED.** BC-5.40.001's §Story
Anchor still read "Dual-story anchor: S-17.01; S-19.08," omitting S-17.05 and carrying a now-stale
cardinality-quantifier word, even though the v1.10 pass-25 fix had already added S-17.05 to the
Traceability §Stories row. BC-7.07.001's §Story Anchor still read only "S-18.04a," likewise
omitting S-17.05 despite the v1.28 pass-25 fix having added it to the Traceability §Stories row.
Product-owner corrected BC-5.40.001's §Story Anchor to "Tri-story anchor: S-17.01; S-19.08;
S-17.05" (quantifier corrected to match the three-story count) and BC-7.07.001's §Story Anchor to
list both S-18.04a and S-17.05. This generalizes TD-VSDD-060 one layer further: resolving a
`[pending]` implementing-story anchor to a real story ID must sweep ALL sibling loci in the SAME
burst — §Story Anchor (including any cardinality quantifier), §Traceability §Stories, status/
lifecycle parity, `inputs:` completeness, and every prose mention — not just the Traceability rows
the initial fix touched. BC-5.40.001 v1.10→**v1.11**; BC-7.07.001 v1.28→**v1.29**.

**F-P27-002 (MED, POLICY 17, status/lifecycle contradiction) — FIXED.** BC-7.07.001's frontmatter
carried `status: draft` while `lifecycle_status: active` and the BC-INDEX status cell already read
`active` — a same-file contradiction plus an index/file divergence. Adjudicated: the
precompact-flush plugin this BC governs has shipped (S-18.04a, E-18 EPIC COMPLETE); sibling BCs
BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001 carry the identical pending-S-17.05-amendment condition under `status:
active` (spec-leading-code per this repo's VSDD standing rule); a pending amendment does not make
an already-shipped base contract draft. Product-owner corrected `status: draft` → `status: active`,
reconciling the file to what BC-INDEX already stated. Not escalated to architect — a mechanical
sibling-parity + lifecycle-consistency adjudication answerable in scope per the CANONICAL
PRINCIPLE.

**F-P27-003 (MED, POLICY 18, inputs: completeness) — FIXED.** BC-7.07.001's `inputs:` frontmatter
list was incomplete relative to what its own normative body prose depends on (LOCK_RENEWAL_TTL_SECS
/ `parse_iso8601` / `flp::parse_factory_lock` code claims, Precondition 1's registry stanza,
EC-004's BC-4.13.001-EC-009 alignment). Product-owner expanded `inputs:` with
`.factory/specs/behavioral-contracts/ss-04/BC-4.13.001.md`, `crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs`,
`crates/factory-lock-parse/src/lib.rs`, `crates/hook-plugins/precompact-flush/src/lib.rs`,
`crates/hook-plugins/verify-factory-lock/src/lib.rs`, and
`plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks-registry.toml` — mirroring sibling BC-4.17.001's already-complete
input set for the same code surface. BC-4.17.001 itself RETAINED UNCHANGED this burst (its mutual
`inputs:` cite of BC-7.07.001 is the existing, already-settled cyclic-hash TD — see Index
reconciliation below; not re-opened).

**O-P27-001 (LOW, non-blocking, cosmetic) — FIXED.** BC-7.07.001's `modified:` changelog array had
the v1.19–v1.23 block interleaved out of strict descending-chronological order (landing after
v1.24 instead of before it). Product-owner reordered the array into strict
descending-chronological sequence; no content changed, array element order only.

**Artifact versions (product-owner edits already on disk before this state-manager burst;
reconciled same-commit):** BC-5.40.001 v1.10→**v1.11**; BC-7.07.001 v1.28→**v1.29**. ADR-046
v1.12 UNCHANGED this burst (no ADR touched — all three findings are BC-only). Input-hashes
recomputed via `plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/compute-input-hash --update`: BC-5.40.001
`d046d5a`→**`0a80aa5`**; BC-7.07.001 `fea7819`→**`056b419`**.

**BC-4.17.001 ↔ BC-7.07.001 mutual `inputs:` cyclic-hash TD — RECONFIRMED, settled, NOT
re-opened.** BC-4.17.001 lists both BC-5.40.001.md and BC-7.07.001.md in its own `inputs:`; with
both siblings' content now changed (BC-5.40.001 v1.11, BC-7.07.001 v1.29), BC-4.17.001's stored
input-hash `407e0ff` is confirmed one round behind the freshly-recomputed value `485373a` — the
identical class of expected residue already documented and settled at the existing `[D-1082]`
Drift Item in STATE.md (a BC one cycle behind its own cyclic-input siblings' latest content is not
a new defect). BC-4.17.001 itself was NOT touched this burst (no PC/Invariant/EC/Traceability
content of BC-4.17.001 required correction); its stored input-hash is deliberately left
UNCHANGED, consistent with the pass-25 precedent, cross-referenced against `[D-1082]` rather than
opening a new Drift Item.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **BC-INDEX v4.98→v4.99:** BC-5.40.001 row Version cell v1.10→v1.11 appended (F-P27-001
  disposition); BC-7.07.001 row Version cell v1.28→v1.29 appended (F-P27-001/002/003/O-P27-001
  disposition). BC-7.07.001 row's status cell already read `active` (no cell edit required — the
  file was the stale side of that divergence, now reconciled). Stories cells for both rows already
  listed S-17.05 since D-1082 (UNCHANGED — no cell edit required, the finding was §Story-Anchor-
  section prose inside the BC files, not a BC-INDEX Stories-cell gap). No new BC registered;
  total_bcs UNCHANGED 1988; SS-04/SS-05/SS-07 counts UNCHANGED.
- ARCH-INDEX v3.82 UNCHANGED (no ADR touched this burst). VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED. STORY-INDEX
  v4.391 UNCHANGED.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, STATE.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md for the superseded version strings `BC-5.40.001.*v1\.10\b` and
`BC-7.07.001.*v1\.28\b` (anchored to the BC-ID context to avoid bare-number false positives) —
only the BC-INDEX row cells and STATE.md Current-Artifact-Versions/Phase-Progress/frontmatter
loci matched, all updated in this same burst; no propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset);
Current Artifact Versions BC-5.40.001 v1.10→v1.11, BC-7.07.001 v1.28→v1.29 (+ status draft→active);
Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-27 3 findings found+fixed, fresh
pass-28 NEXT); O-P26-001 awareness-note Drift Item row updated/closed (BC-7.07.001 `status:active`
condition it flagged is now resolved to plain `active` with no draft/active contradiction — the
underlying spec-leading-code condition via the S-17.05 anchor still holds and is unchanged, only
the frontmatter contradiction O-P26-001 flagged is now moot); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed
(§2 Convergence Counter 0/3 REMAINS, fresh pass-28 NEXT; §3 BC-5.40.001 v1.11/BC-7.07.001 v1.29;
§7 resume command); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1084 (Current Phase
Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1080 row archived off, already fully preserved in
decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory-tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst —
→1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-27 COMPLETE. 3 findings (1 HIGH F-P27-001 §Story-Anchor
sibling-sweep gap, 2 MED F-P27-002 status/lifecycle + F-P27-003 inputs-completeness) found and
fixed same-burst, plus 1 non-blocking LOW cosmetic fix (O-P27-001). All four traced to the SAME
S-17.05-retrofit sibling-sweep root event; the class is now closed across both companion BCs.
Streak REMAINS 0/3 (no further reset — was already 0/3 entering this pass). Fresh pass-28 is the
documented NEXT action; needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1085

**D-1085-ADR046-PASS28-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1084 (this cycle's decision-log.md; the F5 cycle at `cycles/v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1/decision-log.md`
tops out at D-454, well below). D-1085 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 28 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.12 + BC-4.17.001 v1.12 + BC-7.07.001 v1.29 + BC-5.40.001 v1.11). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(2: 1 HIGH + 1 MED) + 2 LOW observations.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset
at pass-25; findings do not reset an already-0/3 streak further). Root cause: the pass-27 (D-1084)
fixes landed on BC-7.07.001 without sweeping siblings, creating both an inputs-omission straggler
AND two FALSE recorded premises injected into BC-7.07.001's own disposition text. Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-28.md`.

**F-P28-001 (HIGH, POLICY 18, inputs: completeness + false cross-reference) — FIXED.** (a) Neither
ADR-046's nor BC-4.17.001's `inputs:` cited `crates/factory-lock-parse/src/lib.rs`, despite both
making heavily load-bearing claims against that crate (ADR-046's F-P25-001/v1.11 correction rests
entirely on `flp::parse_factory_lock`'s `LockState` return type; BC-4.17.001's Precondition 4 /
VP-TBD-7 / VP-TBD-8 / §Architecture Anchors all cite the crate directly). (b) BC-7.07.001's own
v1.29 F-P27-003 disposition falsely claimed its `inputs:` addition of the same file was "mirroring
sibling BC-4.17.001's input set" — BC-4.17.001's `inputs:` did NOT contain the file at that time.
Architect added the crate (+ `BC-7.07.001.md`, found via a sanity sweep of ADR-046's own
Source/Origin §) to ADR-046's `inputs:`. Product-owner independently added the crate to
BC-4.17.001's `inputs:` (justified against BC-4.17.001's own claims, not derivative of BC-7.07.001's
false claim) and corrected BC-7.07.001's v1.29 disposition text IN PLACE (folded into the v1.30
bump alongside F-P28-002, per POLICY 14's erratum convention). ADR-046 v1.12→**v1.13**; BC-4.17.001
v1.12→**v1.13**; BC-7.07.001 v1.29→**v1.30** (values unchanged from v1.29 for this leg, prose-only
correction).

**F-P28-002 (MED, POLICY 17/4, false sibling-parallel claim) — FIXED.** BC-7.07.001's own v1.29
F-P27-002 status-flip rationale falsely stated "sibling BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001 both carry `status:
active` + `lifecycle_status: active`" — FALSE for BC-4.17.001, which is correctly `status: draft`
because its own base deliverable (S-17.05) has not shipped; BC-4.17.001 and BC-7.07.001 are
asymmetric on this axis (BC-7.07.001's own base, `precompact-flush`, DID ship via S-18.04a — the
actual, sufficient, independent reason `status: active` is correct). Product-owner corrected the
v1.29 disposition text IN PLACE: now stands on BC-7.07.001's own shipped-base grounds, cites
BC-5.40.001 alone for sibling-parity precedent, and explicitly notes BC-4.17.001's draft status is
correct and unaffected. Neither `status`/`lifecycle_status`/`inputs:` VALUES changed from v1.29 —
only the disposition prose. BC-7.07.001 v1.29→**v1.30** (same bump as F-P28-001(b)).

**O-P28-001 (LOW, non-blocking, accepted-per-convention) — NO FIX NEEDED.** A stale `FactoryLock`
type-name cite (superseded by F-P25-001/D-1082's `LockState` correction) survives only in PRESERVED
HISTORICAL dated changelog entries (pre-F-P25-001 rows); live body text is correct across all three
artifacts. Historical changelog rows are immutable audit trail per this repo's standing convention;
left untouched, same treatment as other historical-preservation Drift Items.

**O-P28-002 (LOW, `[process-gap]`, 3+ RECURRENCE) — ROOT-CAUSE FIXED.** ADR-046's own File-Change
Plan self-referential version-bump directive (a row instructing ARCH-INDEX what version to cite)
went stale a THIRD time (F-P25-002 added a new row without sweeping the directive forward;
F-P26-001 caught and rewrote a stale "v1.10" straggler to "v1.12"; this pass catches it again —
would go stale a fourth time the moment this very burst's v1.13 bump landed, if left in
literal-directive form). Architect restructured the row to a version-stable instruction:
state-manager now reads ADR-046's live frontmatter `version:` field at bump time rather than the
row embedding a literal number, structurally preventing recurrence. Historical "Prior (vX.Y)..."
disposition chain preserved as-is. Lesson recorded `[codified]`.

**Artifact versions (architect + product-owner edits already on disk before this state-manager
burst; reconciled same-commit):** ADR-046 v1.12→**v1.13**; BC-4.17.001 v1.12→**v1.13**; BC-7.07.001
v1.29→**v1.30**. BC-5.40.001 v1.11 UNCHANGED this burst (no touch — not implicated in any pass-28
finding). Input-hashes recomputed via `plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/compute-input-hash --update`:
ADR-046 `26c1c59`→**`076b3a7`**; BC-4.17.001 `407e0ff`→**`4ae09b2`**; BC-7.07.001
`056b419`→**`69e452c`**.

**BC-4.17.001 ↔ BC-7.07.001 mutual `inputs:` cyclic-hash TD — RECONFIRMED, EXTENDED to a 3-way
cycle, settled, NOT re-opened.** ADR-046 now cites `BC-7.07.001.md` in its own `inputs:` (added
this burst per F-P28-001), and both companion BCs already cite `ADR-046.md` in theirs — the
2-artifact cyclic-hash TD tracked since D-1082 now structurally extends to a 3-artifact cycle. The
three recomputed hashes above reflect a single sequential update pass (ADR-046, then BC-4.17.001,
then BC-7.07.001); because each file's stored `input-hash` field is itself part of what its
cyclic-dependent siblings hash, no single ordering leaves all three simultaneously mutually
self-consistent — the same class of expected residue already documented and settled at the
existing `[D-1082]` Drift Item, extended (not reopened as a new item) to cover the third leg.
Per this pass's task instruction, no attempt was made to chase full convergence via repeated
re-computation rounds; the current triple is accepted as this burst's settled state.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **ARCH-INDEX v3.82→v3.83:** ADR-046 row bumped v1.12→v1.13; "RATIFIED..." sentence version cite
  updated; pass-27 (UNCHANGED, no ADR touch, BC-only findings) + pass-28 (F-P28-001 HIGH +
  F-P28-002 MED fixed, O-P28-001/O-P28-002 LOW recorded) summary appended ahead of the preserved
  pass-26 summary; "Fresh pass-27" trailing sentence replaced with "Fresh pass-29 is the documented
  NEXT action."
- **BC-INDEX v4.99→v5.00:** BC-4.17.001 row version-history v1.12→v1.13 appended (F-P28-001(a));
  BC-7.07.001 row version-history v1.29→v1.30 appended (F-P28-001(b)+F-P28-002). No new BC
  registered; total_bcs UNCHANGED 1988; SS-04/SS-05/SS-07 counts UNCHANGED.
- STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md for the superseded version strings `ADR-046.*v1\.12\b`, `BC-4\.17\.001.*v1\.12\b`, and
`BC-7\.07\.001.*v1\.29\b` (anchored to the artifact-ID context to avoid bare-number false
positives) — matches confined to: (1) PRESERVED HISTORICAL dated changelog/last_amended rows in
BC-INDEX/ARCH-INDEX (correctly immutable, not a propagation gap), and (2) the STATE.md loci updated
in this same burst. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset); Current
Artifact Versions ADR-046 v1.12→v1.13, BC-4.17.001 v1.12→v1.13, BC-7.07.001 v1.29→v1.30; Blocking
Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-28 2 findings found+fixed, fresh pass-29 NEXT);
cyclic-hash Drift Item ([D-1082]) updated to reflect the 3-way extension and new hash triple; new
non-blocking Drift Item row for O-P28-001 (accepted-per-convention); O-P28-002 noted CODIFIED/
root-cause-fixed; Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3 REMAINS, fresh pass-29 NEXT;
§3 ADR-046 v1.13/BC-4.17.001 v1.13/BC-7.07.001 v1.30; §7 resume command); Phase Progress + Current
Phase Steps rows added for D-1085 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 —
D-1081 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory-tail
unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-28 COMPLETE. 2 findings (1 HIGH F-P28-001 inputs:
completeness + false cross-reference, 1 MED F-P28-002 false sibling-parallel claim) found and fixed
same-burst, plus 1 non-blocking LOW accepted-per-convention (O-P28-001) and 1 LOW process-gap
root-cause-fixed/codified (O-P28-002, closing a 3+ recurrence class). Streak REMAINS 0/3 (no
further reset — was already 0/3 entering this pass). Fresh pass-29 is the documented NEXT action;
needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1086

**D-1086-ADR046-PASS29-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1085 (this cycle's decision-log.md; the F5 cycle at `cycles/v1.0-feature-engine-discipline-pass-1/decision-log.md`
tops out at D-454, well below). D-1086 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 29 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.13 + BC-4.17.001 v1.13 + BC-7.07.001 v1.30 + BC-5.40.001 v1.11). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(3: 1 HIGH + 2 MED), 0 LOW observations.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset
at pass-25; findings do not reset an already-0/3 streak further). Fixed via a coordinated
architect ∥ product-owner sweep. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-29.md`.

**F-P29-001 (HIGH, POLICY 4, spec-vs-code home-crate mis-attribution) — FIXED.** ADR-046
self-contradicted on `rewrite_expires_at`'s home crate: F-P10-001's own v1.8 citation (Companion
Amendment 2's write-composition paragraph, and its own v1.8 Changelog restatement) correctly states
`rewrite_expires_at` is confirmed at `crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs`'s `renew_lock_with_now` Step
5, but two OTHER loci — the Companion Amendment 2 PC4-reconciliation bullet, and the v1.8 Changelog
entry's own closing sentence — described it as "the same mechanism `factory-lock-write.sh`'s own
`_update_expires_at` and `rewrite_expires_at` already use," wrongly locating `rewrite_expires_at`
INSIDE the bash script (`plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/factory-lock-write.sh`, confirmed by inspection
to declare only `_epoch_to_iso`/`_write_factory_lock_block`/`_update_expires_at` — no
`rewrite_expires_at`). BC-4.17.001's PC4 carried the identical mis-attribution, mirroring ADR-046's
error. Architect corrected both ADR-046 loci (Companion Amendment 2 PC4-reconciliation bullet + the
v1.8 Changelog entry's closing sentence) to attribute `rewrite_expires_at` to
`crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs`'s `renew_lock_with_now` (Rust) while keeping
`factory-lock-write.sh`'s `_update_expires_at` (bash) as the correctly-attributed bash-side
precedent — both mechanisms remain cited together (neither is a byte-range/patch API; both
serialize the whole file with one region altered), only the file-of-record for
`rewrite_expires_at` changed. A full-document sweep for `rewrite_expires_at` confirmed these were
the only two mis-attributing loci in ADR-046. Product-owner independently corrected BC-4.17.001's
PC4 to cite the identical two-mechanism pairing. ADR-046 v1.13→**v1.14**; BC-4.17.001
v1.13→**v1.14**.

**F-P29-002 (MED, POLICY 18, `inputs:` completeness) — FIXED.** BC-5.40.001's `inputs:` frontmatter
array omitted 5 load-bearing code files despite this BC making exact-code-body current-state
claims against them: PC3's `is_expired` comparison against `verify-factory-lock`; the migrated
Precondition 6/Invariant 7/Invariant 8/EC-010 `STATE_MD_MAX_BYTES`/`extract_frontmatter` claims;
PC4's `renew_lock_if_holder`/`TTL_SECONDS` claims; and the `hooks-registry.toml` deregistration
claim. This BC was de-scoped from the POLICY 18 sweep already applied to BC-7.07.001 (v1.29) and
BC-4.17.001 (v1.13) at pass-28 — a sibling-sweep straggler of that same class. Product-owner added
`crates/hook-plugins/verify-factory-lock/src/lib.rs`, `crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs`,
`crates/factory-lock-parse/src/lib.rs`, `crates/hook-plugins/verify-state-timestamp-refresh/src/lib.rs`,
and `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks-registry.toml` to BC-5.40.001's `inputs:`, same path form the
sibling BCs already use. Not the accepted BC-4.17.001↔BC-7.07.001↔ADR-046 mutual-inputs
cyclic-hash TD (that concerns only that triple's mutual ADR/BC edges) — these are missing CODE
inputs, legitimately in-scope and independent of the cyclic-hash class. BC-5.40.001
v1.11→**v1.12**.

**F-P29-003 (MED, POLICY 17/14, `modified:` array ordering re-regression) — FIXED.** BC-7.07.001's
`modified:` array sequence was `v1.29, v1.30, v1.28, v1.27, ...` — the newest entry (v1.30 at the
time) sat in the SECOND slot instead of the top of an otherwise strict-descending array, a
RE-REGRESSION of O-P27-001 (pass-27 fixed the identical defect class); the v1.30 edit reintroduced
it by appending its own new entry directly above the v1.29 entry it was correcting, rather than at
the true top of the array. Product-owner reordered the entire `modified:` array to strict
descending-chronological (newest at top) — v1.31, v1.30, v1.29, v1.28, ... down to v1.1 — verified
against the Changelog table (already correctly ordered, newest-row-first). Dated HISTORICAL entry
text (v1.1 through v1.30) unchanged — only array position corrected, per POLICY 1 append-only
numbering. BC-7.07.001 v1.30→**v1.31**.

**Novelty assessment (adversary, Part B):** the behavioral core (write-composition table,
five-outcome table, identity-gating logic, event-sourcing struct-variant text) is verified CLEAN
and stable across three consecutive passes (27, 28, 29) — no regression of any settled
behavioral-content fix. However the spec has NOT fully converged: the metadata/hygiene layer
(`inputs:` completeness, array-ordering discipline, cross-reference accuracy) continues to shed
partial-fix regressions of the immediately-prior burst's own fix, one pass at a time — F-P29-001 is
a genuinely NEW defect class (a cross-language home-crate mis-attribution never covered by any
prior cross-language attribution audit), while F-P29-002 and F-P29-003 are both partial-fix
regressions of the immediately-prior pass's own fixes (BC-5.40.001's de-scoping from the pass-28
POLICY 18 sweep; a literal re-regression of O-P27-001).

**Artifact versions (architect + product-owner edits already on disk before this state-manager
burst; reconciled same-commit):** ADR-046 v1.13→**v1.14**; BC-4.17.001 v1.13→**v1.14**; BC-5.40.001
v1.11→**v1.12**; BC-7.07.001 v1.30→**v1.31**. Input-hashes recomputed via
`plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/compute-input-hash --update`, in sequence ADR-046 → BC-4.17.001 →
BC-5.40.001 → BC-7.07.001: ADR-046 `076b3a7`→**`4a19928`**; BC-4.17.001 `4ae09b2`→**`f3ccd4c`**;
BC-5.40.001 `0a80aa5`→**`19893f0`**; BC-7.07.001 `69e452c`→**`e65a1d0`**.

**Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` — RECONFIRMED, BC-5.40.001's participation CONFIRMED, settled, NOT
re-opened.** The 3-way cycle (ADR-046 ↔ BC-4.17.001 ↔ BC-7.07.001) tracked since `[D-1082]` and
extended at D-1085 remains non-convergent this pass: a re-check of ADR-046 and BC-4.17.001
immediately after all four sequential `--update` calls confirms both again read DRIFT (ADR-046
`4a19928`≠computed `141b9d1`; BC-4.17.001 `f3ccd4c`≠computed `81e72b7`), the same class of expected
residue as D-1085. Additionally, BC-5.40.001 is now CONFIRMED to participate in the same cyclic
tangle: it already cited ADR-046, BC-4.17.001, and BC-7.07.001 in its own `inputs:` prior to this
burst (unchanged by F-P29-002, which added only code files); with all three siblings edited this
same burst, BC-5.40.001's hash is unavoidably affected regardless of its own content edit, and —
because both ADR-046 and BC-4.17.001 cite BC-5.40.001 in their own `inputs:` — the cycle now
effectively spans all four artifacts. This is the SAME class of expected residue already documented
and settled at `[D-1082]`, extended (not reopened as a new item) to note BC-5.40.001's confirmed
participation. Per this pass's task instruction, no attempt was made to chase full convergence via
repeated re-computation rounds; the current quadruple is accepted as this burst's settled state.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **ARCH-INDEX v3.83→v3.84:** ADR-046 row bumped v1.13→v1.14 (version-stable directive read
  live `version:` field per O-P28-002); pass-29 summary appended ahead of the preserved pass-28
  summary; "Fresh pass-29 is the documented NEXT action" trailing sentence replaced with "Fresh
  pass-30 is the documented NEXT action."
- **BC-INDEX v5.00→v5.01:** BC-4.17.001 row version-history v1.13→v1.14 appended (F-P29-001
  mirror); BC-5.40.001 row version-history v1.11→v1.12 appended (F-P29-002); BC-7.07.001 row
  version-history v1.30→v1.31 appended (F-P29-003). No new BC registered; total_bcs UNCHANGED 1988;
  SS-04/SS-05/SS-07 counts UNCHANGED.
- STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Convention divergence (non-blocking, recorded for human decision, NOT resolved this burst):** the
architect corrected ADR-046's historical v1.8 Changelog mis-attribution IN PLACE (rewriting the
dated v1.8 entry's own closing sentence), while the product-owner LEFT BC-4.17.001's historical
v1.7-equivalent mis-attribution text untouched per the dated-history convention (BC-4.17.001's PC4
correction was applied only to the LIVE body text, not to any historical changelog restatement).
This is an OPEN convention question: which policy governs correcting a factually-wrong statement
inside a PRESERVED HISTORICAL dated changelog/Changelog entry — POLICY 1 (append-only / leave
history as originally written, the convention `O-P28-001` invoked) vs. the general
correct-misleading-code-attribution obligation this same pass applied to live text. Recorded as a
new Drift Item; not adjudicated this burst.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md for the superseded version strings `ADR-046.*v1\.13\b`, `BC-4\.17\.001.*v1\.13\b`,
`BC-5\.40\.001.*v1\.11\b`, and `BC-7\.07\.001.*v1\.30\b` (anchored to the artifact-ID context to
avoid bare-number false positives) — matches confined to: (1) PRESERVED HISTORICAL dated
changelog/`last_amended` rows in BC-INDEX/ARCH-INDEX (correctly immutable, not a propagation gap),
and (2) the STATE.md loci updated in this same burst. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset); Current
Artifact Versions ADR-046 v1.13→v1.14, BC-4.17.001 v1.13→v1.14, BC-5.40.001 v1.11→v1.12, BC-7.07.001
v1.30→v1.31; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-29 3 findings found+fixed,
fresh pass-30 NEXT); cyclic-hash Drift Item (`[D-1082]`) updated to record BC-5.40.001's confirmed
participation; new non-blocking Drift Item row for the convention-divergence open question; Session
Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3 REMAINS, fresh pass-30 NEXT; §3 ADR-046 v1.14/BC-4.17.001
v1.14/BC-5.40.001 v1.12/BC-7.07.001 v1.31; §7 resume command); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps
rows added for D-1086 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1082 row
archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory-tail unchanged
(Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-29 COMPLETE. 3 findings (1 HIGH F-P29-001 home-crate
mis-attribution + 2 MED F-P29-002 `inputs:` completeness + F-P29-003 `modified:` array
re-regression) found and fixed same-burst, 0 LOW observations. Streak REMAINS 0/3 (no further
reset — was already 0/3 entering this pass). Fresh pass-30 is the documented NEXT action; needs 3
consecutive clean passes for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1087

**D-1087-ADR046-PASS30-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1086 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1087 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 30 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.14 + BC-4.17.001 v1.14 + BC-7.07.001 v1.31 + BC-5.40.001 v1.12). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(2: 1 HIGH + 1 MED), 0 LOW observations.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset
at pass-25; findings do not reset an already-0/3 streak further). Findings narrowed to pure
metadata parity — **NO spec-vs-code contradictions this pass**; all substance cross-checks
(behavioral core, write-composition, event-sourcing, type-provenance, §Story Anchor parity,
POLICY 19) re-verified CLEAN with zero regression. Fixed via a coordinated architect ∥
product-owner COMPREHENSIVE per-dimension sweep (not spot-fixes). Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-30.md`.

**F-P30-001 (HIGH, POLICY 14/17, `modified:`/Changelog array-ordering parity) — FIXED.**
BC-4.17.001's and BC-5.40.001's `modified:` frontmatter arrays were both ordered ASCENDING (oldest
at top) while their own Changelog tables were correctly ordered DESCENDING (newest at top) — the
same defect class F-P29-003 fixed on sibling BC-7.07.001 at pass 29, never swept to these two
siblings (a pre-existing instance of the class, not a new regression of the pass-29 fix).
Product-owner reordered BOTH arrays to strict descending-chronological, matching each BC's own
Changelog table, and ran a full 3-BC cluster parity audit (version / Changelog-head /
modified-head / last_amended-prefix parity, `inputs:` completeness, §Story-Anchor↔§Traceability
cardinality) confirming BC-7.07.001 already clean on all five legs — no edit required there. Dated
HISTORICAL entry text unchanged in both BCs; only array position corrected, per POLICY 1
append-only numbering. BC-4.17.001 v1.14→**v1.15**; BC-5.40.001 v1.12→**v1.13**.

**F-P30-002 (MED, POLICY 18, `inputs:` completeness) — FIXED.** ADR-046's own `inputs:`
frontmatter array omitted 6 load-bearing files it makes exact current-state claims against:
`crates/factory-dispatcher/src/invoke.rs` and `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/host/exec_subprocess.rs`
(§Decision 2/F-005 config-scope-equivalence + §Context WASI-clock claims),
`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/verify-state-timestamp-refresh.bats` and
`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/validate-state-structure/pass-real-state-md-snapshot.bats`
(Consequences/Negative + Source/Origin "Tests requiring rewrite" claims),
`.factory/stories/S-17.05-stamp-state-timestamp-hook.md` (File-Change Plan's S-17.05 row content
claim), and `.factory/policies.yaml` (Companion Amendments 5/6 quote its POLICY 19 `scope:`
array). Architect ran a MANDATORY complete inputs-completeness audit of the full document body
(not a spot sweep, per explicit task direction that pass-28's own sweep had missed the first two
of these six files) and added all six; explicitly rejected as non-load-bearing padding:
`STORY-INDEX.md`, `ARCH-INDEX.md` (already covered by `traces_to:`), `ci.yml` (cited only as a
proposed future location). No `modified:` array exists in ADR-046's frontmatter, so no reordering
finding applies to it. ADR-046 v1.14→**v1.15**.

**Convergence-strategy technique lesson (recorded, see lessons.md):** passes 27, 28, and 29 each
shed a partial-fix regression/straggler of the immediately-prior pass's own fix (single-locus
spot-fixing perpetuates stragglers). This pass's remediation switched to COMPREHENSIVE
per-dimension sweeps — reorder ALL BC `modified:` arrays cluster-wide, audit EVERY ADR-cited file
rather than only the flagged locus — rather than spot-fixing only the two loci the adversary
explicitly flagged. If pass-31 is clean, this technique is what closed the metadata layer.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **ARCH-INDEX v3.84→v3.85:** ADR-046 row bumped v1.14→v1.15 (version-stable directive read live
  `version:` field per O-P28-002); pass-30 summary appended ahead of the preserved pass-29 summary;
  "Fresh pass-30 is the documented NEXT action" trailing sentence replaced with "Fresh pass-31 is
  the documented NEXT action."
- **BC-INDEX v5.01→v5.02:** BC-4.17.001 row version-history v1.14→v1.15 appended (F-P30-001);
  BC-5.40.001 row version-history v1.12→v1.13 appended (F-P30-001). BC-7.07.001 row UNCHANGED
  (already clean at v1.31, confirmed by cluster audit, no edit). No new BC registered; total_bcs
  UNCHANGED 1988; SS-04/SS-05/SS-07 counts UNCHANGED.
- STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst):** ADR-046 `4a19928`→`b18f058`; BC-4.17.001
`f3ccd4c`→`5012d14`; BC-5.40.001 `19893f0`→`5d9e223`. BC-4.17.001↔BC-7.07.001↔ADR-046↔BC-5.40.001
mutual `inputs:` cyclic-hash TD (tracked since `[D-1082]`, extended to 4-way at D-1086) settled
per this pass's task instruction, cross-referenced against the existing `[D-1082]` Drift Item, NOT
reopened as a new item — this burst's recompute does not resolve the cycle, consistent with prior
passes.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md for the superseded version strings `ADR-046.*v1\.14\b`, `BC-4\.17\.001.*v1\.14\b`, and
`BC-5\.40\.001.*v1\.12\b` (anchored to the artifact-ID context to avoid bare-number false
positives) — matches confined to: (1) PRESERVED HISTORICAL dated changelog/`last_amended` rows in
BC-INDEX/ARCH-INDEX (correctly immutable, not a propagation gap), and (2) the STATE.md loci
updated in this same burst. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset); Current

only the last 5 — D-1083 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md).
Trajectory-tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-30 COMPLETE. 2 findings (1 HIGH F-P30-001 `modified:`/
Changelog ordering parity + 1 MED F-P30-002 `inputs:` completeness) found and fixed same-burst via
COMPREHENSIVE per-dimension sweeps, 0 LOW observations. No spec-vs-code contradictions — findings
are pure metadata parity. Streak REMAINS 0/3 (no further reset — was already 0/3 entering this
pass). Fresh pass-31 is the documented NEXT action; needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal
3-CLEAN.

## D-1088

**D-1088-ADR046-PASS31-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1087 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1088 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 31 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.15 + BC-4.17.001 v1.15 + BC-7.07.001 v1.31 + BC-5.40.001 v1.13). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(2 MED), 0 HIGH, 0 LOW observations.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset at
pass-25; findings do not reset an already-0/3 streak further). Both flagged findings are pure
BC-cross-reference/`inputs:`-hygiene defects — **NO spec-vs-code contradictions this pass**; all
substance cross-checks (behavioral core, write-composition, event-sourcing, type-provenance,
§Story Anchor parity, POLICY 19, F-P30-001-class array-ordering) re-verified CLEAN with zero
regression. Fixed by product-owner. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-31.md`.

**F-P31-001 (MED, POLICY 18, `inputs:` completeness) — FIXED.** BC-5.40.001's `inputs:`
frontmatter omitted BC-4.13.001 and BC-6.23.001 despite this BC's own body citing both as
load-bearing current-state authorities (BC-4.13.001: PC2/PC3/PC4/Invariant 6/Invariant 8 and
Invariant 9/10 TTL-boundary + malformed-block + soft-warn-threshold cites; BC-6.23.001: PC1/PC4
acquire-writes/unlock-clears cites). Both sibling BCs (BC-4.17.001, BC-7.07.001) and ADR-046
already listed both files — BC-5.40.001 was never itself swept for this specific pair.
Product-owner added both to `inputs:`, same path form the siblings already use. BC-5.40.001
v1.13→**v1.14**.

**F-P31-002 (MED, POLICY 4, cross-reference accuracy) — FIXED.** BC-7.07.001's Postcondition 3
Shared-classifier-mandate paragraph cited "BC-5.40.001 §Invariant 2" (the 2700-second TTL VALUE)
for the `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` timestamp-FORMAT requirement — verified against BC-5.40.001's actual
section content: the format requirement is stated in BC-5.40.001 §Precondition 3 (restated at PC1),
not §Invariant 2. Product-owner retargeted the citation to `BC-5.40.001 §Precondition 3`.
BC-7.07.001 v1.31→**v1.32**.

**Audit-extra stragglers (found and fixed same-burst, in-scope per production-grade default — NOT
part of the adversary's flagged 2-finding set; surfaced by the comprehensive cross-anchor and
spec-inputs completeness audits product-owner ran in response to F-P31-001/F-P31-002, per the
D-1087 convergence-strategy technique extended to a THIRD dimension — verify every cross-anchor
citation and every spec-inputs claim inside the SAME BC the flagged finding already touched, not
just sweep sibling BCs sharing the flagged defect class):**

- **BC-5.40.001 own-body cross-anchor straggler:** BC-5.40.001's own Precondition 4 and
  Postcondition 2 cited "BC-6.23.001 PC3/PC4" for `/factory-unlock` clearing behavior — verified
  BC-6.23.001 PC3 is "`/factory-lock` foreign lock held: refuse" (an ACQUIRE-path refusal,
  unrelated to `/factory-unlock`); the self-release clearing act is BC-6.23.001 PC4 alone. Both
  occurrences corrected from "BC-6.23.001 PC3/PC4" to "BC-6.23.001 PC4". No PC/Invariant/EC
  renumbered (POLICY 1 append-only preserved).
- **BC-7.07.001 spec-inputs completeness straggler:** BC-7.07.001's body made load-bearing
  current-state claims against five spec files absent from its own `inputs:` — BC-5.40.001 (the
  just-corrected §Precondition 3 cite + Related-BCs "depends on" relationship), BC-5.41.003
  (`MULTI_COMMIT_CHAIN_NOT_ALLOWED` exemption/false-positive-block claims), BC-1.15.001
  (dispatcher-routes-PreCompact-events claim), BC-2.02.011, and
  `.factory/specs/domain-spec/invariants.md`. All five added to `inputs:`.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** the substantive behavioral spec for this
ADR/BC cluster has converged — the remaining defect surface across passes 27-31 is entirely
cross-reference and frontmatter integrity, never logic or spec-vs-code contradiction. This pass
CONFIRMS (does not refute) the D-1087 convergence-strategy hypothesis: applying the comprehensive
per-dimension-sweep technique to a BROADER scope (full cross-anchor semantic audit + full
spec-inputs completeness audit against the SAME BC a flagged finding already touched, not just
sibling-BC array-ordering) caught 3 additional genuine defects same-burst that a spot-fix of only
the 2 flagged findings would have left for pass-32/33 to discover piecemeal. The 2 flagged findings
demonstrate the technique alone does not yet reach a literal-CLEAN pass on first application to a
new dimension — but its yield (3 extra defects closed same-burst) is the convergence accelerant
this gate needs.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **BC-INDEX v5.02→v5.03:** BC-5.40.001 row version-history v1.13→v1.14 appended (F-P31-001 +
  audit-extra BC-6.23.001 PC3/PC4→PC4-only correction); BC-7.07.001 row version-history v1.31→v1.32
  appended (F-P31-002 + audit-extra 5-file `inputs:` completion). No new BC registered; total_bcs
  UNCHANGED 1988; SS-04/SS-05/SS-07 counts UNCHANGED.
- ARCH-INDEX v3.85 UNCHANGED — no ADR touched this pass. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX
  v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst, literal shell):** BC-5.40.001
`5d9e223`→`e357a3c`→`da34eb2` (recomputed twice this burst — the first recompute, immediately after
BC-7.07.001's own recompute, was itself invalidated by BC-7.07.001's `inputs:`-audit content change
since BC-5.40.001 cites `BC-7.07.001.md` in its own `inputs:`; `da34eb2` is the settled final
value); BC-7.07.001 `e65a1d0`→`8495a56`. Re-checking BC-7.07.001 after BC-5.40.001's second
recompute shows BC-7.07.001's own stored hash `8495a56` is in turn now one hop stale relative to
BC-5.40.001's final `da34eb2` (BC-7.07.001 cites `BC-5.40.001.md` in its own `inputs:`, added this
same burst) — this is the tangle itself, not a fresh defect; NOT chased further, per this pass's
task instruction. BC-4.17.001↔BC-7.07.001↔ADR-046↔BC-5.40.001
mutual `inputs:` cyclic-hash TD (tracked since `[D-1082]`, extended to 4-way at D-1086) settled per
this pass's task instruction, cross-referenced against the existing `[D-1082]` Drift Item, NOT
reopened as a new item — BC-5.40.001's and BC-7.07.001's `inputs:` arrays grew this burst (the
tangle's edge set is unchanged in KIND — BC-5.40.001 already cited BC-7.07.001 and vice versa
pre-burst — only each file's own hash value moved), consistent with prior passes.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md for the superseded version strings `BC-5\.40\.001.*v1\.13\b` and
`BC-7\.07\.001.*v1\.31\b` (anchored to the artifact-ID context to avoid bare-number false
positives) — matches confined to: (1) PRESERVED HISTORICAL dated changelog/`last_amended` rows in
BC-INDEX/STATE.md (correctly immutable, not a propagation gap), and (2) the STATE.md loci updated
in this same burst. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset); Current

## D-1089

**D-1089-ADR046-PASS32-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1088 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1089 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 32 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.15 + BC-4.17.001 v1.15 + BC-7.07.001 v1.32 + BC-5.40.001 v1.14). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(1 HIGH), 0 MED, 0 LOW observations.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset at
pass-25; a finding does not reset an already-0/3 streak further). All OTHER dimensions explicitly
confirmed clean by the adversary — cross-anchors resolve, cardinalities match, every code claim
verified, status pairs consistent — **NO further findings**. Fixed by product-owner. Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-32.md`.

**F-P32-001 (HIGH, POLICY 14/17, `modified:`-array/head-version parity) — FIXED.** BC-7.07.001's
`modified:` frontmatter array was missing its own v1.32 entry: `version:`, the `## Changelog`
table's newest row, and the `last_amended:` prefix all correctly read v1.32 (three of four in-file
parity legs agreed), but the `modified:`-array's TOP (newest) entry still read v1.31 — the Pass-31
edit that produced v1.32 updated the other three legs but never prepended the corresponding
`modified:` entry. Product-owner bumped `version:` 1.32→**1.33**; prepended a new v1.33 `modified:`
entry plus a BACKFILLED v1.32 entry (mirroring the existing v1.32 `last_amended` disposition text
verbatim), restoring strict-descending order with no gaps; added a `## Changelog` v1.33 row;
re-verified all 4 in-file parity legs now agree on v1.33. No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered (POLICY 1
append-only preserved). BC-7.07.001 v1.32→**v1.33**.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** the substantive behavioral spec for this
ADR/BC cluster remains converged — six passes running (27-32), the defect surface has been entirely
cross-reference and frontmatter integrity, never logic or spec-vs-code contradiction. This pass's
sole finding is itself a *process*-layer defect — an incomplete version-bump propagation from the
immediately-prior burst — rather than a fresh *content* defect surfaced by review of the underlying
behavioral spec.

**CODIFICATION — 3rd+ recurrence of the `modified:`-array-head-omission-on-version-bump class
(F-P29-003, F-P30-001, F-P32-001):** bumping `version:` + the `## Changelog` table + `last_amended:`
while forgetting to prepend the corresponding `modified:`-array head entry has now recurred three
times across this gate's history. CODIFIED this burst: every BC/artifact version bump MUST run a
4-leg head==version self-check (`version:` == `modified:`-array-head == `## Changelog`-table-head
== `last_amended:`-prefix, with NO gap in the `modified:` array) BEFORE the burst is declared done.
Per the S-7.02 cycle-closing checklist, a follow-up anchor is recorded for a MECHANICAL
`validate-modified-head-parity` validator hook (develop-branch Rust/WASM code work, out of
factory-artifacts scope — `validate-changelog-monotonicity` already exists but does NOT check
modified-head==version; anchored to the same S-15.03 PRIORITY-A automation tranche as the other
mechanical-consistency-checker follow-ups this gate has already accumulated, e.g. the `[D-1082]`
cyclic-hash structural fix). Codified in `lessons.md` tagged `[codified][process-gap]`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **BC-INDEX v5.03→v5.04:** BC-7.07.001 row version-history v1.32→v1.33 appended (F-P32-001). No
  new BC registered; total_bcs UNCHANGED 1988; SS-04/SS-05/SS-07 counts UNCHANGED.
- ARCH-INDEX v3.85 UNCHANGED — no ADR touched this pass. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX
  v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst, literal shell):** BC-7.07.001
`8495a56`→`eabeda0`. This is a normal (non-cyclic) recompute — BC-7.07.001's own `inputs:` array was
not touched this burst, only its `version:`/`modified:`/Changelog/`last_amended` fields; the
`[D-1082]` 4-way cyclic-hash tangle (ADR-046↔BC-4.17.001↔BC-5.40.001↔BC-7.07.001 mutual `inputs:`
cites) is UNCHANGED/settled, NOT reopened, NOT chased further — BC-5.40.001's own stored hash
(`da34eb2`) is unaffected since BC-7.07.001's `inputs:` array itself did not change this burst (only
BC-7.07.001's own frontmatter fields outside `inputs:` changed).

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md for the superseded version string `BC-7\.07\.001.*v1\.32\b` (anchored to the artifact-ID
context to avoid bare-number false positives) — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL dated
changelog/`last_amended` rows (correctly immutable, not a propagation gap) and the STATE.md loci
updated in this same burst. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset); Current
Artifact Versions BC-7.07.001 v1.32→v1.33, ADR-046/BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001 UNCHANGED; Blocking
Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-32 1 HIGH finding found+fixed, fresh pass-33
NEXT); new Drift Item recording the codified 4-leg-parity discipline + follow-up
`validate-modified-head-parity` validator anchor; Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak
0/3 REMAINS, fresh pass-33 NEXT, human decision to CONTINUE looping recorded; §3 ADR-046
v1.15/BC-4.17.001 v1.15/BC-5.40.001 v1.14/BC-7.07.001 v1.33; §7 resume command); Phase Progress +
Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1089 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last
5 — D-1084 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory
tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-32 COMPLETE. 1 HIGH finding (F-P32-001, the 3rd+ recurrence
of the `modified:`-array-head-omission class, CODIFIED this burst) found and fixed same-burst by
product-owner; 0 MED, 0 LOW observations. All other dimensions explicitly confirmed clean by the
adversary. No spec-vs-code contradictions — the finding is pure frontmatter-internal-consistency.
Streak REMAINS 0/3 (no further reset — was already 0/3 entering this pass). Fresh pass-33 is the
documented NEXT action; needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1090

**D-1090-ADR046-PASS33-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1089 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1090 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 33 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.15 + BC-4.17.001 v1.15 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33 + BC-5.40.001 v1.14). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(1 MED), 0 HIGH, 0 LOW observations.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak REMAINS 0/3 (already reset at
pass-25; a finding does not reset an already-0/3 streak further). Adversary explicitly stated:
absent this one item the set would be CLEAN — all other dimensions confirmed clean. Fixed by
architect. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-33.md`.

**F-P33-001 (MED, POLICY 18, `inputs:` completeness) — FIXED.** ADR-046's own `inputs:`
frontmatter array omitted `crates/hook-sdk/src/result.rs`, cited by exact path in §Context's
central PostToolUse-vs-PreToolUse feasibility claim ("`HookResult` ... is `Continue | Block
{ reason } | Error { message }` — there is no modified-input path"), the load-bearing fact this
ADR's whole Decision rests on. Architect added `crates/hook-sdk/src/result.rs` to `inputs:`, in the
same crate-path form already used for the ADR's other `crates/hook-sdk` citation.

**Mandatory GREP-COMPLETE audit (architect, this burst):** per explicit task direction that passes
28/30/31 had each still shed exactly one straggler despite believing themselves complete, a
MECHANICAL `grep -noE` sweep (not a read-through) was run across every file-path-shaped token class
in the document body. This found exactly one further genuine, non-padding omission of the same
parity-gap character: `.factory/specs/behavioral-contracts/ss-04/BC-4.17.001.md` — cited ~20 times
through the document (Decision 2/F-005, Decision 5's reconciliation table, Companion Amendment 1's
"mirror verbatim into BC-4.17.001," a dedicated File-Change Plan row, and a specific current-state
negative-space claim) yet never added even when its three sibling downstream BCs were already
present. Added, same path form. A full enumerated audit table (every distinct file/artifact this
ADR cites as a current-state claim, with disposition) is recorded in the ADR's own v1.16 Changelog
entry.

The same sweep's mandatory bracket-balance verification of ADR-046's own `last_amended` field
additionally surfaced a **latent pre-existing defect**, mechanically discovered rather than
adversary-flagged: the v1.14 `[Prior:` nesting bracket opened at the start of that entry was never
closed across the v1.13→v1.15 lineage — invisible without a stack-based bracket count. Closed by
adding one additional trailing `]` (a stack-based parse of the corrected field now confirms zero
unmatched opens and zero unmatched closes).

ADR-046 v1.15→**v1.16**. BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED at v1.15/v1.14/v1.33 (all
three audited, confirmed clean, no edit).

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** the substantive behavioral spec for this ADR/BC
cluster remains converged — seven passes running (27-33), the defect surface has been entirely
`inputs:`-completeness/cross-reference/frontmatter-hygiene integrity, never logic or spec-vs-code
contradiction. This pass's finding IS an `inputs:`-completeness item (the same class passes
28/30/31 each addressed), but this is the first time the GREP-COMPLETE mechanical audit method —
as opposed to a read-through — was applied to this specific check, and it is what finally drained
it, catching the flagged item plus 2 further audit-extras in the same sweep.

**CODIFICATION — inputs-completeness audits MUST be GREP-COMPLETE, not human read-throughs:**
passes 28, 30, and 31 each ran an "inputs-completeness audit" that its own authoring agent believed
was complete, yet each still shed exactly one straggler discovered only on the NEXT pass (pass-28's
sweep missed 2 files pass-30 caught; pass-30's sweep missed the S-17.05/`policies.yaml` items
pass-31... — pattern: prose-narrative "I read the whole document and found every citation" audits
are not exhaustive). CODIFIED this burst: an inputs-completeness audit is only valid if it is
GREP-COMPLETE — mechanical file-path-token enumeration via `grep -noE` across pattern classes
(`crates/[...]\.rs`, `plugins/[...]\.(sh|toml)`, `.factory/[...]\.(md|yaml)`, bare basenames,
backtick-quoted path literals, `(BC|ADR|VP|DI)-[...]` identifiers), with the resulting per-path
disposition recorded in an auditable table (as done in ADR-046's own v1.16 Changelog entry) — not
a human read-through, however careful. This joins the version-stable-directive (O-P28-002, D-1085)
and 4-leg-parity (D-1089) codifications as the THIRD distinct convergence-technique discipline this
gate's history has produced. Codified in `lessons.md` tagged `[codified][process-gap]`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **ARCH-INDEX v3.85→v3.86:** ADR-046 row bumped v1.15→v1.16; pass-31/32 (ADR-unchanged) + pass-33
  summaries appended.
- BC-INDEX v5.04 UNCHANGED — no BC touched this pass. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX v2.79
  UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst, literal shell):** ADR-046 `b18f058`→`16255a0`.
Adding `BC-4.17.001.md` to ADR-046's own `inputs:` extends the `[D-1082]` 4-artifact cyclic-hash
tangle with a new mutual edge (BC-4.17.001 already cited ADR-046 in its own `inputs:`; ADR-046 now
also cites BC-4.17.001) — settled, cross-referenced against `[D-1082]`, NOT reopened, NOT chased
further (BC-4.17.001's own stored input-hash `5012d14` is unaffected — its `inputs:` array itself
did not change this burst).

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md for the superseded version string `ADR-046.*v1\.15\b` (anchored to the artifact-ID
context to avoid bare-number false positives) — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL dated
changelog/`last_amended` rows (correctly immutable, not a propagation gap) and the STATE.md loci
updated in this same burst. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→0/3 (REMAINS 0/3, explicitly recorded as no-further-reset); Current
Artifact Versions ADR-046 v1.15→v1.16, BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED; ARCH-INDEX
version cell v3.85→v3.86; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-33 1 MED
finding found+fixed, fresh pass-34 NEXT); new Drift Item recording the codified grep-complete-audit
discipline; Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3 REMAINS, fresh pass-34 NEXT, human
decision to CONTINUE looping recorded; §3 ADR-046 v1.16/BC-4.17.001 v1.15/BC-5.40.001 v1.14/
BC-7.07.001 v1.33; §7 resume command); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1090
(Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1085 row archived off, already
fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched
this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-33 COMPLETE. 1 MED finding (F-P33-001, `inputs:`
completeness) plus 2 audit-extra stragglers (BC-4.17.001.md `inputs:` gap, ADR-046 bracket-balance
defect) found and fixed same-burst by architect via a MANDATORY GREP-COMPLETE mechanical audit,
newly CODIFIED this burst as the standing discipline for all future inputs-completeness audits;
0 HIGH, 0 LOW observations. Adversary confirms: absent this one item the set would be CLEAN — all
other dimensions explicitly confirmed clean. No spec-vs-code contradictions. Streak REMAINS 0/3
(no further reset — was already 0/3 entering this pass). Fresh pass-34 is the documented NEXT

## D-1091

**D-1091-ADR046-PASS34-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1090 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1091 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 34 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.15 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33 + BC-5.40.001 v1.14). **VERDICT: CLEAN —
zero findings at any severity.** Every code-vs-spec claim, cross-BC section anchor, 4-leg version
parity, story-anchor cardinality, status/lifecycle pairing, and subsystem label was independently
re-verified TRUE against source. This is the FIRST clean pass this gate has produced across its
34-pass history. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3.** Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-34.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.16 / BC-4.17.001 v1.15 / BC-5.40.001 v1.14 / BC-7.07.001 v1.33. No
version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content
is: persist the pass-34 record, advance the streak counter, and codify the empirical confirmation
below.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** the substantive behavioral spec for this ADR/BC
cluster has been stable since pass-27 (8 consecutive passes, zero regressions); the metadata/hygiene
layer produced a genuine finding on every single pass from 27 through 33 (7 consecutive passes) —
until this pass. Pass-34's zero-finding result is the first direct empirical confirmation that the
THREE convergence-technique disciplines codified across this gate's history — the version-stable
ARCH-INDEX directive (O-P28-002, D-1085), the 4-leg `modified:`-array head==version parity
self-check (D-1089), and the GREP-COMPLETE mechanical inputs-completeness audit method (D-1090) —
together drain the asymptotic metadata floor that single-locus spot-fixes (the technique used
through pass-29) could not reach. **CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged
`[convergence-confirmation][codified]`): applying all three disciplines proactively, from the start
of a pass rather than only after a fresh finding forces their discovery, is confirmed (not merely
hypothesized) to be sufficient to reach a literal zero-finding result on this gate.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.04, ARCH-INDEX
v3.86, VP-INDEX v2.79, STORY-INDEX v4.391 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `16255a0`, BC-4.17.001 `5012d14`, BC-5.40.001 `da34eb2`, BC-7.07.001
`eabeda0`) remain valid and unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT
chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-33" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1082..D-1090 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, first clean pass); Current Artifact Versions
UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.16, BC-4.17.001 v1.15, BC-5.40.001 v1.14, BC-7.07.001 v1.33); Blocking Issues
ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3, pass-34 CLEAN, fresh pass-35 NEXT); Session Resume Checkpoint
refreshed (§2 streak 1/3, fresh pass-35 NEXT against the unchanged frozen set, human decision to
CONTINUE looping recorded; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress +
Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1091 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last
5 — D-1086 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory
tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-34 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any
severity.** This is the FIRST clean pass in this gate's history. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak
ADVANCES 0/3 → **1/3**. No spec artifact edited; no version bump; no input-hash recompute; no
4-INDEX change. CODIFIED this burst: the empirical confirmation that the three previously-codified
convergence-technique disciplines (version-stable directive, 4-leg parity, grep-complete inputs
audit), applied together and proactively, are sufficient to reach a literal-clean result on this
gate. Fresh pass-35 is the documented NEXT action against the SAME unchanged frozen set; needs 2
more consecutive clean passes (35, 36) for literal 3-CLEAN.

**D-1092-ADR046-PASS35-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1091 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1092 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 35 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.15 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33 + BC-5.40.001 v1.14). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(2: 1 HIGH + 1 MED), 0 LOW observations.** A NEWLY-REVEALED audit dimension no prior audit on this
gate had covered — ADR §Decision/section-anchor correctness (as opposed to BC-to-BC `§Section`
cross-reference correctness, which every prior comprehensive audit confined itself to). **BC-5.39.001
3-CLEAN streak RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** (a finding after the pass-34 clean pass resets the counter). Fixed
by product-owner. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-35.md`.

**F-P35-001 (HIGH, POLICY 4, semantic-anchoring-integrity) — FIXED.** 3 loci across 2 companion BCs
(BC-4.17.001 §Precondition 4, BC-5.40.001 §Precondition 6, BC-5.40.001 §Architecture Anchors)
mis-cited `ADR-025 §Decision 12 §12.5` ("Shared parse logic — no duplication" — the
`factory-lock-parse` crate-extraction decision, stating no byte-cap value) as the decision
establishing the 256 KiB `STATE_MD_MAX_BYTES` read cap. The decision that actually raised the cap
65536→262144 is `§Decision 14` ("verify-factory-lock read-cap 262144 + frontmatter-only parse"),
whose own "Normative twin" line names `BC-4.13.001 §Precondition 3 (Phase-A)` — the same BC all 3
loci already cross-cite. Corrected all 3 loci to `ADR-025 §Decision 14`. The 262144 VALUE itself was
correct at all 3 loci throughout — this is a mis-anchor (wrong decision number), not a wrong figure.
BC-5.40.001's separate `§Decision 7 fail-open` clause was independently re-verified against ADR-025
§Decision 7 and confirmed CORRECT, left unchanged.

**F-P35-002 (MED, POLICY 18, `inputs:` completeness) — FIXED.** BC-4.17.001's `inputs:` frontmatter
omitted ADR-025 despite §Precondition 4 citing it as a load-bearing cap-sourcing authority (the same
sentence F-P35-001 corrected); sibling BC-5.40.001 and BC-7.07.001 both already list it. Added
`.factory/specs/architecture/decisions/ADR-025-single-writer-factory-locklease-prevent-concurrent-session-races-on-factory-artifacts-orphan-branch.md`
to BC-4.17.001's `inputs:` array.

**Mandatory comprehensive ADR §Decision anchor audit (mandatory, in-scope, newly-revealed
dimension):** architect independently audited ADR-046 for the same dimension — ADR-046's only
cross-ADR anchor (ADR-025 §Decision 12 §12.2, byte-comparison semantics) verified correct against
ADR-025's actual text — **CLEAN, no edit, ADR-046 stays v1.16 UNCHANGED.** Product-owner audited
BC-7.07.001 for the same dimension — CLEAN, no mis-anchor found, no edit. Product-owner's audit
confirms only the 3 F-P35-001 loci (across all 3 companion BCs) were mis-anchored on this dimension
— no other ADR-025/ADR-046 `§Decision`/`§N.M` citation anywhere in the frozen set is wrong.

BC-4.17.001 v1.15→**v1.16**. BC-5.40.001 v1.14→**v1.15**. ADR-046/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED at
v1.16/v1.33 (both audited, confirmed clean, no edit).

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** every prior comprehensive cross-anchor audit on
this gate (D-1088's cross-anchor semantic audit, D-1090/D-1091's grep-complete inputs audits)
checked BC-to-BC `§Section`/`PCn`/`Invariant-N` references and `inputs:`-array completeness, but
none independently re-derived "which ADR-025 `§Decision N` actually established this cap" from
ADR-025's own section content — they verified the BC's PARAPHRASE of the cited decision's content
was accurate (and correctly found that clean), never that the decision NUMBER itself was correct.
This pass is the first to extend anchor-correctness discipline to ADR §Decision/`§N.M` citations
themselves, structurally distinct from the BC-to-BC `§Section` citation class every prior
comprehensive audit (F-P31-002 class) already covers. **CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md,
tagged `[codified][process-gap]`): comprehensive cross-anchor audits MUST validate BOTH `BC→BC
§Section` anchors AND `ADR §Decision`/`§N.M` anchors against the cited target's actual content —
the two are structurally distinct citation classes and a clean result on one does not imply the
other is clean.

**Meta-observation (recorded, see lessons.md, NOT a fix, decision-relevant for the human's
continue-vs-accept-provisional choice):** the gate reached 1/3 at pass-34 (the first literal-CLEAN
result in this gate's 34-pass history) and then RESET at pass-35 on a previously-unaudited lens.
This is empirical confirmation — not merely a hypothesis — of the asymptotic-floor reality already
recorded at D-1091: a fresh-context adversary pass can reveal a genuinely new dimension the prior
codified disciplines did not cover, even immediately following a literal zero-finding CLEAN result.
The substance stayed clean throughout — both findings this pass are the same cap-migration-lineage
citation cluster defect, not a behavioral or write-composition regression.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **BC-INDEX v5.04→v5.05:** BC-4.17.001 row version-chain cell +v1.16; BC-5.40.001 row
  version-chain cell +v1.15.
- ARCH-INDEX v3.86 UNCHANGED — ADR-046 not touched this pass. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX
  v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst, literal shell):** BC-4.17.001 `5012d14`→`a88dde0`;
BC-5.40.001 `da34eb2`→`2da1abb`. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED/settled — neither BC's `inputs:`
array gained a new edge into the existing 4-artifact tangle (BC-4.17.001 gained ADR-025, which is
outside the tangle's participant set); NOT reopened, NOT chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-34" as the current/NEXT pass, to
streak value `1/3`, or to the superseded `ADR-025 §Decision 12 §12.5` citation string — matches
confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1082..D-1091 entries correctly describing their own
contemporaneous pass numbers/streak values/citations at the time) and this same burst's own new
content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**0/3** (RESETS, explicitly recorded); Current Artifact Versions
BC-4.17.001 v1.15→v1.16, BC-5.40.001 v1.14→v1.15, ADR-046/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED v1.16/v1.33;
BC-INDEX version cell v5.04→v5.05; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak RESET 0/3,
pass-35 2 findings found+fixed, fresh pass-36 NEXT); new Drift Item recording the codified
ADR-anchor audit dimension plus the asymptotic-floor meta-observation; Session Resume Checkpoint
refreshed (§2 streak 0/3 RESET, fresh pass-36 NEXT against the newly-frozen set, human decision to
CONTINUE looping recorded; §3 versions updated; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress +
Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1092 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last
5 — D-1087 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory
tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-35 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (2: 1 HIGH + 1 MED), 0 LOW
observations.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **RESETS 1/3 → 0/3.** Both findings FIXED same-burst by
product-owner: F-P35-001 (HIGH) 3-locus ADR-025 §Decision 12-vs-14 mis-anchor corrected;
F-P35-002 (MED) BC-4.17.001 `inputs:` completed with ADR-025. Newly-revealed audit dimension
(ADR §Decision anchor correctness) CODIFIED this burst as a mandatory comprehensive-audit
discipline, alongside the three prior convergence-technique disciplines. Architect independently
confirmed ADR-046 itself clean on this dimension (no edit). Meta-observation recorded: the
pass-34-to-pass-35 clean-then-reset sequence empirically confirms the asymptotic-floor reality —
decision-relevant for the human's continue-vs-accept-provisional choice. Fresh pass-36 is the
documented NEXT action against the newly-frozen set; needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal
3-CLEAN.

## D-1093

**D-1093-ADR046-PASS36-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1092 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1093 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 36 dispatched against the newly-frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.16 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33 + BC-5.40.001 v1.15) — the set produced by
the pass-35 fix burst. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any severity.** Every code-vs-spec
claim, cross-BC section anchor, 4-leg version parity, story-anchor cardinality, status/lifecycle
pairing, subsystem label, and — critically — every `ADR-NNN §Decision N`/`§N.M` citation (the
FOURTH dimension codified at D-1092/pass-35) was independently re-verified TRUE against source.
This is the **SECOND clean pass** this gate has produced across its 36-pass history, following the
pass-35 reset. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3.** Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-36.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.16 / BC-4.17.001 v1.16 / BC-5.40.001 v1.15 / BC-7.07.001 v1.33. No
version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content
is: persist the pass-36 record, advance the streak counter, and codify the confirmation that the
FOURTH convergence-technique discipline (ADR §Decision/§N.M anchor audit, codified at D-1092) — not
merely the 3 loci pass-35 explicitly fixed — is now drained across the entire frozen set.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-36 re-applied all FOUR now-codified
convergence-technique disciplines proactively from the start, including the ADR-anchor audit that
reset the streak just one pass prior. Zero mis-anchors were found anywhere in the frozen set on
this dimension — not just at the 3 loci pass-35 corrected, but across every `ADR-NNN §Decision`
citation in all four artifacts, including ADR-046's own sole cross-ADR anchor and BC-5.40.001's
separate `§Decision 7` citation. **CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged
`[convergence-progress][codified]`): this is the first direct evidence that the FOURTH discipline,
applied proactively, closes the class it targets the same way the first three disciplines closed
theirs at pass-34 — evidence, not yet proof (one pass); 2 further consecutive clean passes (37, 38)
are required to confirm this holds under BC-5.39.001's literal 3-CLEAN standard.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.05, ARCH-INDEX
v3.86, VP-INDEX v2.79, STORY-INDEX v4.391 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `16255a0`, BC-4.17.001 `a88dde0`, BC-5.40.001 `2da1abb`, BC-7.07.001
`eabeda0`) remain valid and unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT
chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-35" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1082..D-1092 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, 2nd clean pass, following the pass-35 reset);
Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.16, BC-4.17.001 v1.16, BC-5.40.001 v1.15,
BC-7.07.001 v1.33); Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3, pass-36 CLEAN, fresh
pass-37 NEXT); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 1/3, fresh pass-37 NEXT against the
unchanged frozen set, notes pass-34→35-reset→36 history, human decision to CONTINUE looping
recorded; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps
rows added for D-1093 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1088 row
archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged
(Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-36 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any
severity.** This is the SECOND clean pass this gate has produced, and the FIRST to confirm the
FOURTH (ADR-anchor) discipline drained across the whole frozen set. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak
ADVANCES 0/3 → **1/3**. No spec artifact edited; no version bump; no input-hash recompute; no
4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-37 is the documented NEXT action against the SAME unchanged frozen set;
needs 2 more consecutive clean passes (37, 38) for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1094

**D-1094-ADR046-PASS37-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1093 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1094 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 37 dispatched against the SAME unchanged
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.16 + BC-5.40.001 v1.15 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33). **VERDICT:
FINDINGS (1 MED), 0 HIGH, 1 LOW observation.** **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** — the
SECOND reset of the session (first at pass-35 on a genuinely new audit dimension; this one on a
bookkeeping error inside that dimension's own remediation narrative). Fixed by product-owner. Full
record: `adv-adr-046-pass-37.md`.

**F-P37-001 (MED, POLICY 4, semantic-anchoring-integrity) — FIXED.** BC-4.17.001 v1.16's and
BC-5.40.001 v1.15's own `modified:`/`last_amended`/Changelog amendment prose (the pass-35
remediation's OWN audit-narrative text describing its mandatory ADR §Decision anchor audit, 3 loci
each) falsely asserted ADR-046 has "a flat `## Decision` list, 1–5, ... read in full, all correct."
ADR-046's `## Decision` section is actually a flat numbered list of **6** items — item 6 (same-
release ship + CI-gating registry-invariant XOR check,
`has_entry(verify-state-timestamp-refresh) XOR has_entry(stamp-state-timestamp)`) was silently
omitted from both BCs' self-attested "read in full" count. This is a citation-COUNT defect confined
to the remediation's own bookkeeping narrative — every actual `ADR-046 Decision N` citation in both
BCs' live body text (Decision 1/1(a)/1(b), 2, 4, 5) remains correctly numbered and independently
re-verified unaffected. Corrected the decision-count assertion from "1–5" to "1–6" across all 6
loci (3 in BC-4.17.001 v1.16→v1.17, 3 in BC-5.40.001 v1.15→v1.16), naming item 6 explicitly, with
MINIMAL factual disposition prose — no new completeness certification substituted in its place.

**O-P37-001 ([process-gap], LOW) — recorded, not a fix.** Self-attested "read in full, all correct"
audit-narrative claims have no mechanical backing — nothing greps the cited artifact's actual
section-list cardinality against the prose's own count assertion at write-time. See lessons.md for
the mitigation this triggers.

**Latent defect additionally drained (proactive, PO-surfaced, not a fresh finding):** BC-5.40.001's
own `last_amended` field carried a pre-existing nested-history bracket-count defect (16 `[Prior:`
opens vs. 13 closing `]`s), predating this pass and unrelated to F-P37-001; corrected to 16/16
balanced in the same v1.16 bump. Cosmetic only — no parse-tooling reads `last_amended` as anything
but an opaque string.

BC-4.17.001 v1.16→**v1.17**. BC-5.40.001 v1.15→**v1.16**. ADR-046/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED at
v1.16/v1.33 (neither carries the defective narrative — not touched).

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** NOT a newly-revealed dimension the way pass-35
was (pass-35 discovered ADR §Decision anchor-correctness as an entirely unaudited citation CLASS).
Pass-37's finding is a factual miscount inside a narrative description of a fully-covered,
already-codified dimension (the ADR §Decision anchor audit itself, D-1092) — the audit discipline
is sound; this particular instance of applying it (at pass-35) mis-stated its own cardinality.
**CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged `[codified][process-gap]`): fix-burst disposition
prose that makes a sweeping self-attested completeness claim ("read in full, all correct") is
itself falsifiable attack surface for a fresh-context adversary; the MITIGATION now in force is
that fix-burst disposition prose must be MINIMAL and factual, and self-attested audits need
mechanical (greppable) backing rather than a bare completeness assertion.

**Meta-observation (recorded, see lessons.md, NOT a fix, decision-relevant for the human's
continue-vs-accept-provisional choice):** the gate has now reached 1/3 twice (pass-34, pass-36) and
RESET twice (pass-35 on the ADR-anchor dimension, pass-37 on the remediation-prose bookkeeping of
that same dimension) — the SECOND reset came from the remediation's OWN bookkeeping rather than
from a fresh spec-vs-code defect, empirically strengthening the "prose-only codification → literal
3-CLEAN structurally fragile" reality already recorded at D-1091/D-1092 (cf. F5-cycle
L-EDP1-007/051/061). The human RE-AFFIRMED "CONTINUE looping toward literal 3-CLEAN" at this
decision point — accept-provisional under D-386 Option C was offered and declined again, the second
such reaffirmation this session.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **BC-INDEX v5.05→v5.06:** BC-4.17.001 row version-chain cell +v1.17; BC-5.40.001 row
  version-chain cell +v1.16.
- ARCH-INDEX v3.86 UNCHANGED — ADR-046 not touched this pass. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX
  v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst, literal shell):** BC-4.17.001
`a88dde0`→`a663cb5`→`4970575` — settled after a second recompute made necessary by BC-5.40.001's own
same-burst `modified:`/`last_amended` prose change, since BC-4.17.001 cites BC-5.40.001.md.
BC-5.40.001 `2da1abb`→`4e4f7a0` — computed after BC-4.17.001's first-round change; a one-hop
residual drift now exists between BC-5.40.001's stored hash and a fresh recompute against
BC-4.17.001's FINAL value, exactly the same cyclic-hash TD [D-1082] tangle behavior recorded at
D-1085/D-1088/D-1090 — NOT chased further (chasing it would ping-pong indefinitely; the tangle
itself is the accepted, cross-referenced TD).

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-36" as the current/NEXT pass, to
streak value `1/3`, or to the superseded "1–5" ADR-046 decision-count assertion — matches confined
to PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1082..D-1093 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous
pass numbers/streak values/citations at the time) and this same burst's own new content. No
propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**0/3** (RESETS, explicitly recorded, 2nd reset this session);
Current Artifact Versions BC-4.17.001 v1.16→v1.17, BC-5.40.001 v1.15→v1.16, ADR-046/BC-7.07.001
UNCHANGED v1.16/v1.33; BC-INDEX version cell v5.05→v5.06; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated
(streak RESET 0/3, pass-37 1 finding found+fixed, fresh pass-38 NEXT); new Drift Item recording the
minimal-prose + mechanical-audit-backing codification; Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2
streak 0/3 RESET, fresh pass-38 NEXT against the newly-frozen set, records the 34→35reset→36→37reset
streak history, human decision to CONTINUE looping recorded again; §3 versions updated; §7 resume
command updated); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1094 (Current Phase Steps
table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1089 row archived off, already fully preserved in
decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1,
LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-37 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED), 0 HIGH, 1 LOW
observation.** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** (2nd reset this session). F-P37-001
(MED) FIXED same-burst by product-owner: ADR-046 decision-count 1–5→1–6 corrected across both BCs'
own v1.15/v1.16 amendment narratives (6 loci total). O-P37-001 ([process-gap], LOW) recorded — no
mechanical backing for self-attested audit completeness claims. Latent bracket-balance defect
(16/13→16/16) additionally drained on BC-5.40.001. CODIFIED this burst: fix-burst disposition prose
must be MINIMAL and factual — no sweeping self-attested completeness certifications. Meta-observation
recorded: the gate has now reached 1/3 twice and RESET twice, the second reset from the
remediation's own bookkeeping rather than a fresh spec-vs-code defect — empirical strengthening of
the asymptotic-floor reality. Human RE-AFFIRMED CONTINUE looping toward literal 3-CLEAN (declined
accept-provisional again). Fresh pass-38 is the documented NEXT action against the newly-frozen set;
needs 3 consecutive clean passes for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1095

**D-1095-ADR046-PASS38-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1094 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1095 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 38 dispatched against the SAME unchanged
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.17 + BC-5.40.001 v1.16 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33) produced by
the pass-37 fix burst. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any severity.** Every code-vs-spec claim,
cross-BC section anchor, 4-leg version parity, story-anchor cardinality, status/lifecycle pairing,
subsystem label, the ADR §Decision/§N.M anchor-correctness dimension (D-1092/pass-35's reset
dimension), AND the self-attested cardinality/completeness-claim dimension (D-1094/pass-37's reset
dimension) were all independently re-verified TRUE against source — including an independent recount
of ADR-046's own `## Decision` section (confirmed 6 items) against both BCs' now-corrected "1–6"
amendment prose. This is the **THIRD clean pass** this gate has produced this session (after pass-34
and pass-36, both subsequently reset), and the first to directly re-verify BOTH previously-reset
dimensions in the same pass. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3.** Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-38.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set is
UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.16 / BC-4.17.001 v1.17 / BC-5.40.001 v1.16 / BC-7.07.001 v1.33. No version
bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content is: persist
the pass-38 record, advance the streak counter, and codify the confirmation that the
minimal-prose + mechanical-audit-backing mitigation (D-1094) is holding — the newly-covered
enumeration-count and bracket-balance dimensions both returned clean this pass, alongside every
previously-codified dimension.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-38 re-applied every now-codified
convergence-technique discipline proactively from the start, including the two dimensions whose
discovery caused this session's two resets (ADR-anchor correctness at pass-35; self-attested
cardinality claims at pass-37). Zero findings on any dimension. **CODIFIED this burst** (see
lessons.md, tagged `[convergence-progress][codified]`): this is the first direct evidence that the
D-1094 mitigation (minimal, factual, mechanically-backed disposition prose) — applied to this pass's
OWN verification narrative, which itself makes no uncounted cardinality claims — holds under a fresh
adversary's independent re-derivation. Evidence, not yet proof (one pass); 2 further consecutive
clean passes (39, 40) are required to confirm this holds under BC-5.39.001's literal 3-CLEAN
standard.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.06, ARCH-INDEX
v3.86, VP-INDEX v2.79, STORY-INDEX v4.391 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `16255a0`, BC-4.17.001 `4970575`, BC-5.40.001 `4e4f7a0`, BC-7.07.001 `eabeda0`)
remain valid and unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-37" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1082..D-1094 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, 3rd clean pass this session, following the pass-37
reset); Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.16, BC-4.17.001 v1.17, BC-5.40.001 v1.16,
BC-7.07.001 v1.33); Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3, pass-38 CLEAN, fresh
pass-39 NEXT); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 1/3, fresh pass-39 NEXT against the
unchanged frozen set, notes full history 34 CLEAN→35 RESET→36 CLEAN→37 RESET→38 CLEAN, human decision
to CONTINUE looping recorded again; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated); Phase
Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1095 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only
the last 5 — D-1090 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md).
Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-38 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any
severity.** This is the THIRD clean pass this gate has produced this session, and the FIRST to
re-confirm BOTH previously-reset dimensions (ADR-anchor correctness, self-attested cardinality
claims) in the same pass. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → **1/3**. No spec artifact
edited; no version bump; no input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-39 is the documented
NEXT action against the SAME unchanged frozen set; needs 2 more consecutive clean passes (39, 40)
for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1096

**D-1096-ADR046-PASS39-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1095 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1096 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 39 dispatched against the SAME unchanged
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.17 + BC-5.40.001 v1.16 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33) produced by
the pass-38 CLEAN pass. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED), 0 HIGH, 0 LOW.** **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak
RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** — the THIRD reset this session. Unlike the pass-35 reset (a newly-revealed
citation-accuracy dimension) and the pass-37 reset (a bookkeeping miscount inside a prior
remediation's own narrative, no data-destructive consequence), **this reset is SUBSTANTIVE**: the
finding is a genuine unreconciled internal contradiction in BC-4.17.001's own OPERATIVE spec content
that would have caused actual data loss if followed literally. Fixed by product-owner. Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-39.md`.

**F-P39-001 (MED, POLICY 4, semantic-anchoring-integrity) — FIXED.** BC-4.17.001 v1.17's
Precondition 4 and Invariant 7 mandated `extract_frontmatter`-slice confinement for BOTH the
`timestamp:` arm AND the `expires_at` arm, directly contradicting Precondition 2's/Invariant 9's own
requirement that `renew_lock_if_holder` be fed the FULL `content_after_pc1` and that both arms
compose into a SINGLE `host::write_file` call. A literal reading of the `expires_at` arm's
slice-exclusivity directive would have fed `renew_lock_if_holder` a frontmatter-only slice,
truncating its `RenewOutcome::Renewed(new_content)` return value to the frontmatter region — and
since that truncated value becomes the entire composed write, this would have DESTROYED STATE.md's
body content on a live write. Not a cosmetic defect: this is a genuine data-truncation hazard hiding
in the BC's own normative text. Corrected: Precondition 4 and Invariant 7 now scope the
extract_frontmatter-slice byte-range restriction to PC1's `timestamp:` scan only; for the
`expires_at` arm, frontmatter confinement is restated as a semantic-region guarantee delegated
internally to `renew_lock_if_holder`/`flp::parse_factory_lock`/`rewrite_expires_at`, while the arm is
still fed full `content_after_pc1` per PC2 — mirroring PC4's own pre-existing "'Targeted' is a
semantic-scope guarantee, not a write-mechanism constraint" framing (the same reconciliation already
applied to the `timestamp:`/PC4 case at Pass-16/O-P16-001, now extended to the sibling `expires_at`
arm). PC1, PC2, and Invariant 9 themselves UNCHANGED — independently re-verified already correct. No
PC/Invariant/EC renumbered (append-only numbering preserved per POLICY 1).

BC-4.17.001 v1.17→**v1.18**. ADR-046/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED at v1.16/v1.16/v1.33 (none
carries the defective directive — not touched).

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** this pass's finding is a THIRD distinct FAILURE
CLASS on this gate, structurally different from both prior resets. Pass-35 (D-1092) found a
citation-accuracy gap (wrong ADR §Decision number, correct value). Pass-37 (D-1094) found a
bookkeeping miscount inside a remediation's own narrative prose (no operative-content risk at all).
**Pass-39 found a genuine unreconciled contradiction inside the BC's own live Precondition/Invariant
text — the kind of defect that, if shipped into the implementing story S-17.05's TDD work, would
have produced a data-destructive bug.** This is the clearest demonstration yet of why the BC-5.39.001
3-CLEAN gate exists: a fresh-context adversary, unaware of 38 prior passes' worth of prose-level
cleanup, traced the write-composition data flow from first principles and found a defect every prior
comprehensive audit (citation accuracy, `inputs:` completeness, array-ordering, cardinality claims)
walked past, because none of those audits included "trace each PC4/Invariant-7 arm's data flow
independently against PC2/Invariant 9's own full-content requirement" as a discrete check.
**CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged `[codified][process-gap][convergence-observation]`):
(a) when a what-vs-how (semantic-scope vs. mechanism) reconciliation is applied to ONE arm/case of a
contract, every sibling arm/case using analogous language MUST receive the same reconciliation in the
SAME burst — this is the arm-parity variant of the sibling-sweep discipline (TD-VSDD-060-adjacent,
but at the clause-arm granularity rather than the callsite granularity); (b) this 3rd reset,
being SUBSTANTIVE rather than metadata/prose, is itself the strongest evidence yet that literal
3-CLEAN convergence — even under five previously-codified disciplines applied proactively — has not
exhausted the space of genuine defects a fresh adversary can find; the gate's continued operation is
justified, not merely ceremonial.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **BC-INDEX v5.06→v5.07:** BC-4.17.001 row version-chain cell +v1.18.
- ARCH-INDEX v3.86 UNCHANGED — ADR-046 not touched this pass. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX
  v2.79 UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst, literal shell, print-mode only):** BC-4.17.001
recomputed and confirmed **UNCHANGED at `4970575`** — no file listed in BC-4.17.001's own `inputs:`
array changed content this burst (ADR-046, BC-5.40.001, and BC-7.07.001 are all UNCHANGED; the only
edit this burst is to BC-4.17.001's OWN body, which is not self-referential in its own `inputs:`
hash computation). Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` NOT triggered this burst — settled, NOT reopened.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-38" as the current/NEXT pass, to
streak value `1/3`, or to the superseded BC-4.17.001 `v1.17` version-chain head — matches confined to
PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1082..D-1095 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous
pass numbers/streak values/versions at the time) and this same burst's own new content. No
propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**0/3** (RESETS, explicitly recorded, 3rd reset this session, this
one SUBSTANTIVE not metadata); Current Artifact Versions BC-4.17.001 v1.17→v1.18, ADR-046/BC-5.40.001/

BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** (3rd reset this session, the first SUBSTANTIVE

F-P39-001 (MED) FIXED same-burst by product-owner: BC-4.17.001 v1.17→v1.18, Precondition 4 +
Invariant 7 arm-scoped to reconcile the `expires_at` arm's full-content feed requirement against the
`timestamp:` arm's frontmatter-slice requirement. CODIFIED this burst: arm-parity sibling-sweep

in the same burst) + meta-observation distinguishing SUBSTANTIVE resets from metadata/prose resets.

## D-1097

**D-1097-ADR046-PASS40-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1096 (this cycle's decision-log.md, backfilled above). D-1097 is allocated cleanly above the true
max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 40 dispatched against the newly-frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.18 + BC-5.40.001 v1.16 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33) produced by the pass-39
fix burst. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED), 0 HIGH, 0 LOW.** **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak STAYS 0/3**
(already 0/3 entering this pass from the pass-39 reset; a finding keeps it at 0/3 rather than
resetting again). Fixed by product-owner. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-40.md`.

**F-P40-001 (MED, POLICY 4, sibling-locus-sweep-completeness) — FIXED.** The pass-39/D-1096
remediation corrected Precondition 4 and Invariant 7 to arm-scope the `extract_frontmatter`-slice
byte-range restriction to the `timestamp:` arm only. That fix did NOT sweep to VP-TBD-8 — the BC's
own §Verification Properties table row carrying the identical guarantee — which still read as a
single joint clause applying frontmatter-slice confinement to BOTH arms, the exact pre-F-P39-001
framing the Precondition/Invariant pair was corrected away from. A literal reading of VP-TBD-8 (the
artifact a verifier would consult to write the corresponding unit test) would re-encode the same
data-destructive hazard F-P39-001 closed. This is direct empirical validation that the D-1096
arm-parity sibling-sweep codification was itself under-applied at v1.18: the sweep covered the
Precondition/Invariant pair but not the VP table, Architecture Anchors, or SDK-grounding blocks
carrying the same guarantee. Corrected: VP-TBD-8 now states the arm split explicitly — PC1's
`timestamp:` scan byte-range-confined to the `extract_frontmatter` slice; PC2's `expires_at`
renewal fed the FULL `content_after_pc1`, verified by post-write STATE.md body byte-preservation,
not slice-consumption. VP-TBD-8's stale internal pointer (`corrected 2026-08-26, F-P15-001`)
corrected to cite the v1.18/F-P39-001 arm-scope split and this v1.19 sweep. **Comprehensive sweep
performed same-burst:** every other locus mentioning `extract_frontmatter`, frontmatter slice/
region, byte-range, or joint PC1/PC2 scoping was checked — Precondition 4, Invariant 7 (both
confirmed correct, arm-split since v1.18, not re-broken), PC1's rewrite-mechanism paragraph, PC3a,
PC4, Invariant 5, Edge Cases, Canonical Test Vectors, Architecture Anchors, and Description —
VP-TBD-8 was the only locus still carrying the joint-arm framing. No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered
(append-only numbering preserved per POLICY 1).

BC-4.17.001 v1.18→**v1.19**. ADR-046/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED at v1.16/v1.16/v1.33 (none
carries the defective directive — not touched).

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** this finding is NOT a new dimension — it is the
FIRST direct empirical validation of the D-1096 arm-parity sibling-sweep codification's own scope.
The codification requires a what-vs-how reconciliation applied to one arm/case to sweep to every
analogous sibling arm/case in the same burst; this pass demonstrates that "sibling arm/case" must be
read to include §Verification Properties rows, Architecture Anchors, and SDK-grounding blocks
carrying the identical guarantee — not just Preconditions/Invariants. **CODIFIED this burst** (see
lessons.md, tagged `[codified][process-gap]`): extend the D-1096 arm-parity sibling-sweep discipline
to explicitly enumerate ALL loci carrying a guarantee — Preconditions, Postconditions, Invariants,
§Verification Properties rows, Architecture Anchors, and SDK-grounding blocks — not just
Preconditions/Invariants, whenever a what-vs-how or arm-scope reconciliation is applied. The pass-40
comprehensive 8-locus sweep (Precondition 4, Invariant 7, PC1's rewrite-mechanism paragraph, PC3a,
PC4, Invariant 5, Edge Cases, Canonical Test Vectors, Architecture Anchors, Description, and
VP-TBD-8 itself) is the model going forward for this class of reconciliation.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):**

- **BC-INDEX v5.07→v5.08:** BC-4.17.001 row version-chain cell +v1.19.
- ARCH-INDEX v3.86 UNCHANGED — ADR-046 not touched this pass. STORY-INDEX v4.391 UNCHANGED. VP-INDEX
  v2.79 UNCHANGED (VP-TBD-8 is not yet VP-registered; see [D-1057] VP-authoring OWED item).

**Input-hash recompute (state-manager, this burst, literal shell, print-mode only):** BC-4.17.001
recomputed and confirmed **UNCHANGED at `4970575`** — no file listed in BC-4.17.001's own `inputs:`
array changed content this burst (ADR-046, BC-5.40.001, and BC-7.07.001 are all UNCHANGED; the only
edit this burst is to BC-4.17.001's OWN body, which is not self-referential in its own `inputs:`
hash computation). Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` NOT triggered this burst — settled, NOT reopened.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-39" as the current/NEXT pass, to
streak value `1/3`, or to the superseded BC-4.17.001 `v1.18` version-chain head — matches confined
to PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1082..D-1096 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous
pass numbers/streak values/versions at the time) and this same burst's own new content. No
propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak stays **0/3** (a finding on an already-0/3 streak does not reset it
further, it simply keeps it at 0/3; explicitly recorded as such, distinguishing this from the prior
three genuine resets); Current Artifact Versions BC-4.17.001 v1.18→v1.19, ADR-046/BC-5.40.001/

**D-1098-ADR046-PASS41-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1097 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1098 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 41 dispatched against the newly-frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.19 + BC-5.40.001 v1.16 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33) produced by the pass-40
fix burst. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any severity.** Every code-vs-spec claim, cross-BC

specifically re-opened and confirmed correct, arm-split, stale pointer correctly citing v1.18/
F-P39-001). This is the **FOURTH clean pass** this gate has produced this session (after pass-34,
pass-36, and pass-38, each subsequently reset or held), and the first to directly re-verify BOTH the
sixth and seventh convergence-technique disciplines together, against the exact frozen set those two
fixes themselves produced. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3.** Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-41.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set is
UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.16 / BC-4.17.001 v1.19 / BC-5.40.001 v1.16 / BC-7.07.001 v1.33. No version
bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content is: persist
the pass-41 record, advance the streak counter, and codify the confirmation that the arm-parity
sibling-sweep discipline (D-1096) and its locus-class extension (D-1097) both hold under independent
fresh-context re-derivation applied together in the same pass.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-41 re-applied every now-codified
convergence-technique discipline proactively from the start, including the two most-recently-codified
dimensions whose discovery produced findings at pass-39 and pass-40. Zero findings on any dimension.
**CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged `[convergence-progress][codified]`): this is the
first direct evidence that the sixth and seventh disciplines (arm-parity sweep + locus-class
extension) together close the class they target — evidence, not yet proof (one pass); 2 further
consecutive clean passes (42, 43) are required to confirm this holds under BC-5.39.001's literal
3-CLEAN standard.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.08, ARCH-INDEX
v3.86, VP-INDEX v2.79, STORY-INDEX v4.391 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `16255a0`, BC-4.17.001 `4970575`, BC-5.40.001 `4e4f7a0`, BC-7.07.001 `eabeda0`)
remain valid and unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-40" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1082..D-1097 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, 4th clean pass this session, following the
pass-40 stay-at-zero); Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.16, BC-4.17.001 v1.19,
BC-5.40.001 v1.16, BC-7.07.001 v1.33); Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3,
pass-41 CLEAN, fresh pass-42 NEXT); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 1/3, fresh
pass-42 NEXT against the unchanged frozen set, notes full history 34CLEAN→35RESET→36CLEAN→
37RESET→38CLEAN→39RESET→40finding(stays 0/3)→41CLEAN, human decision to CONTINUE looping recorded
again; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows
added for D-1098 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1093 row archived
off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not
touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-41 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any
severity.** This is the FOURTH clean pass this gate has produced this session, and the first to
re-confirm BOTH the arm-parity sweep (D-1096) and its locus-class extension (D-1097) in the same
pass. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → **1/3**. No spec artifact edited; no version bump;
no input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-42 is the documented NEXT action against the
SAME unchanged frozen set; needs 2 more consecutive clean passes (42, 43) for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1099

**D-1099-ADR046-PASS42-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1098 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1099 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 42 dispatched against the SAME unchanged
frozen set produced by the pass-40 fix burst and re-confirmed at pass-41 (ADR-046 v1.16 +
BC-4.17.001 v1.19 + BC-5.40.001 v1.16 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33). **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero BLOCKING
findings at any severity.** ONE non-blocking observation surfaced: **O-P42-001 (LOW,
documentary-historical-deferred)** — BC-5.40.001's `modified:` frontmatter array entries for
v1.4–v1.1 are bare version/date strings without disposition prose, whereas v1.5–v1.16 and the
`## Changelog` table carry full prose. This is a PRE-EXISTING cosmetic asymmetry confined to the
oldest, PRE-ADR-046 historical rows — it breaks no 4-leg head-parity check (D-1089 scopes that check
to the array HEAD, not every entry), introduces no propagation gap, and is not caused by or
contemporaneous with ADR-046 or any burst in this gate's history. Same class as the O-P28-001
stale-type-in-history observation and the STORY-INDEX changelog-migration deferral. **ACCEPTED as a
tracked non-blocking documentary-historical item** — see disposition below. Every other now-codified
dimension (arm-parity sweep D-1096, locus-class extension D-1097, ADR §Decision/§N.M anchor
correctness D-1092, self-attested cardinality/completeness-claim discipline D-1094, code claims,
cross-anchors, 4-leg parity, brackets, cardinality, status/lifecycle pairs) was independently
re-verified TRUE against source, the SECOND CONSECUTIVE pass to do so (following pass-41). **This is
the FIFTH clean pass this gate has produced this session** (after pass-34, pass-36, pass-38, and
pass-41), and the SECOND consecutive one, directly following pass-41's own re-confirmation of both
the sixth and seventh convergence-technique disciplines together. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak
ADVANCES 1/3 → 2/3.** Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-42.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set is
UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.16 / BC-4.17.001 v1.19 / BC-5.40.001 v1.16 / BC-7.07.001 v1.33. No version
bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. Fixing O-P42-001 would require editing
BC-5.40.001 — one of the four frozen-set artifacts — which would break the byte-unchanged invariant
this streak depends on, for a cosmetic asymmetry in dated historical rows predating ADR-046 entirely
and carrying no operative risk. **The correct governance call at 2/3 is accept-and-track, not
fix-and-reset** — touching the frozen set to fix a non-defect out of the feature perimeter would
needlessly reset a live convergence streak. This burst's sole content is: persist the pass-42 record,
formally accept O-P42-001 as documentary-historical-deferred, advance the streak counter, and
re-codify that the sixth and seventh disciplines continue to hold under a SECOND consecutive
independent fresh-context re-derivation.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-42 re-applied every now-codified
convergence-technique discipline proactively from the start, including the two most-recently-codified
dimensions. Zero blocking findings; one pre-existing non-blocking observation formally accepted.
**CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged `[convergence-governance]`): at 2/3, a pre-existing
dated-historical cosmetic observation is accepted as documentary-historical-deferred rather than
fixed, because touching the frozen set to fix a non-defect out of the feature perimeter would reset a
live convergence streak — the correct governance call is accept-and-track, not fix-and-reset.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.08, ARCH-INDEX
v3.86, VP-INDEX v2.79, STORY-INDEX v4.391 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `16255a0`, BC-4.17.001 `4970575`, BC-5.40.001 `4e4f7a0`, BC-7.07.001 `eabeda0`)
remain valid and unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-41" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `2/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1082..D-1098 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**2/3** (ADVANCES, 5th clean pass this session, 2nd CONSECUTIVE);
Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.16, BC-4.17.001 v1.19, BC-5.40.001 v1.16,
BC-7.07.001 v1.33); Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 2/3, pass-42 CLEAN with
O-P42-001 accepted, fresh pass-43 NEXT — the convergence pass); Drift Items O-P42-001 row added
(accepted non-blocking, documentary-historical, anchored next maintenance sweep / S-15.03
PRIORITY-A); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 2/3, fresh pass-43 NEXT against the
unchanged frozen set, notes full history 34C→35R→36C→37R→38C→39R→40f→41C→42C, human decision to
CONTINUE looping recorded again; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress +
Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1099 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last
5 — D-1094 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory
tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-42 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero BLOCKING findings at any
severity; ONE non-blocking observation (O-P42-001) formally ACCEPTED as documentary-historical-
deferred.** This is the FIFTH clean pass this gate has produced this session, and the SECOND
CONSECUTIVE one. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 1/3 → **2/3**. No spec artifact edited; no
version bump; no input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-43 is the documented NEXT
action against the SAME unchanged frozen set — this is the CONVERGENCE pass: 1 more consecutive CLEAN
result reaches literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1100

**D-1100-ADR046-PASS43-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1099 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1100 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 43 — **the CONVERGENCE pass** — dispatched
against the SAME unchanged frozen set produced by the pass-40 fix burst and re-confirmed clean at
pass-41/pass-42 (ADR-046 v1.16 + BC-4.17.001 v1.19 + BC-5.40.001 v1.16 + BC-7.07.001 v1.33).
**VERDICT: FINDINGS (2 MED) + 2 observations (O-P43-001 LOW, fixed; O-P43-002 informational, no
action).** Both findings are provenance/cross-reference class, not behavioral-core defects — the
gate's design substance remains re-confirmed converged for the 17th consecutive pass (stable since
pass-27).

**F-P43-001 (MED, POLICY 18, inputs: completeness).** All three companion BCs (BC-4.17.001,
BC-5.40.001, BC-7.07.001) quote their respective capability (CAP-031/CAP-032) verbatim against
`.factory/specs/domain-spec/capabilities.md`, but none of the three BCs' own `inputs:` frontmatter
arrays listed that file — a load-bearing citation gap of the exact character this gate has
repeatedly found and fixed on ADR-046's own `inputs:` (F-P28-001/F-P30-002/F-P33-001), but never
before checked on the BCs' arrays themselves. This burst ran the FIRST mandatory grep-complete
inputs audit (D-1090's discipline) scoped to all three BCs, not just the ADR. Beyond
`capabilities.md`, the audit found 3 further genuinely-missing files on BC-5.40.001 specifically:
`plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/factory-lock-write.sh` (PC4 break-glass-fallback claim),
`plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/verify-git-push.sh` (Precondition 5/Invariant 5 `--force-with-lease`
claim), and `crates/hook-plugins/verify-state-timestamp-refresh/tests/integration_t006_no_output_too_large.rs`
(§VP Anchors literal grep-evidence block). BC-4.17.001 and BC-7.07.001's own audits found no other
gaps beyond `capabilities.md`. Fixed same-burst by product-owner: BC-4.17.001 v1.19→v1.20,
BC-5.40.001 v1.16→v1.17, BC-7.07.001 v1.33→v1.34 (this row shared with F-P43-002 below).

**F-P43-002 (MED, POLICY 4, cross-reference integrity).** ADR-046's Companion Amendment 3 closing
sentence referred to "The BC's existing AC-018" as though AC-018 were a normative
acceptance-criterion section of BC-7.07.001 itself — but BC-7.07.001 has no Acceptance Criteria
section and no AC-NNN numbering scheme at all (confirmed by a full section-heading sweep). AC-018
is in fact a STORY-level acceptance criterion of `.factory/stories/S-18.04a-precompact-flush-sh-core.md`,
tracing to BC-7.07.001's own Postcondition 3 case 5 / Invariant 3 step 4. The mis-scoping was
two-way: BC-7.07.001's own v1.19 Changelog row independently carried the identical "AC-018 ...
UNCHANGED" phrasing (ADR-046 echoed it verbatim, not fabricated it). Fixed same-burst: architect
corrected ADR-046 Companion Amendment 3's closing sentence to "S-18.04a's AC-018 (...; BC-7.07.001
Postcondition 3 case 5 / Invariant 3 step 4) is otherwise unchanged" (ADR-046 v1.16→v1.17);
product-owner mirrored the identical correction into BC-7.07.001's own v1.34 narrative same-burst.

**O-P43-001 (LOW, stale volatile pin, fixed).** BC-4.17.001 Invariant 6 carried a stale BC-to-BC
version pin, `(see BC-5.40.001 v1.5 Invariant 1)` — a POLICY-19-class anti-pattern this gate's
sibling-sweep disciplines had not previously checked for cross-BC version pins specifically.
Stripped to the stable anchor `(see BC-5.40.001 §Invariant 1)`; a sweep of BC-4.17.001 found no
other live-body BC-to-BC version pins (the two other matches are confined to POLICY-1 append-only
dated historical narrative).

**O-P43-002 (informational, no action).** No ADR-046 content is implicated by either finding above
independent of F-P43-002's cross-reference fix; recorded for observation-ledger completeness only.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 2/3 → 0/3 — the 4th reset this session** (after pass-35,
pass-37, pass-39). Qualitatively, this reset sits closer to the pass-35 (citation-accuracy) and
pass-37 (bookkeeping) resets than the pass-39 (data-destructive) reset: both findings are confined
to the provenance/cross-reference perimeter — the behavioral core (write-composition, five-outcome
table, identity-gating, event-sourcing) remains independently re-verified CLEAN, stable for 17
consecutive passes (since pass-27). Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-43.md`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** ARCH-INDEX v3.86→**v3.87** (ADR-046 row
version cell + pass-34..43 narrative summary appended). BC-INDEX v5.08→**v5.09** (BC-4.17.001 row
+v1.20, BC-5.40.001 row +v1.17, BC-7.07.001 row +v1.34 version-chain cells appended). STORY-INDEX
v4.391 and VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (no story or VP touched this burst).

**Input-hash recompute:** performed for all four frozen-set artifacts (mandatory per this burst's
content edits). Final stored values: ADR-046 `8f11d0e`, BC-4.17.001 `39fa054`, BC-5.40.001
`b711178`, BC-7.07.001 `d4b0881`. The 4-artifact cyclic tangle ([D-1082]: BC-4.17.001 ↔
BC-7.07.001 ↔ ADR-046 ↔ BC-5.40.001) means each edit shifts the computed hash of every artifact
that cites the just-edited file — recomputation was iterated across the edit order (ADR-046 →
BC-4.17.001 → BC-5.40.001 → BC-7.07.001, last-edited-settles-exactly convention) until
BC-7.07.001's own stored/computed values matched exactly (settled). ADR-046, BC-4.17.001, and
BC-5.40.001 each carry an accepted 1-hop residual drift relative to BC-7.07.001's later same-burst
edit (their stored hashes reflect the state immediately before BC-7.07.001's own edit landed) —
consistent with the precedent at pass-31/pass-37 ("ONE-HOP residual drift — accepted, NOT chased
further"). Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT force-converged, per this
burst's explicit task direction.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-42" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-reset `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1082..D-1099 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 2/3→**0/3** (RESETS, 4th reset this session); Current Artifact Versions
ADR-046 v1.17, BC-4.17.001 v1.20, BC-5.40.001 v1.17, BC-7.07.001 v1.34 (all four bumped); Blocking
Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-43 FINDINGS with both fixed, fresh pass-44 NEXT
against the newly-frozen set); Drift Items: the D-1090 grep-complete-inputs-audit codification
extended to explicitly cover all cluster artifacts (not just the ADR) per this pass's own finding;
a new AC-owning-artifact citation-discipline lesson recorded; O-P42-001 stays tracked
(documentary-historical-deferred, unaffected by this burst — BC-5.40.001's edit this burst touched
`inputs:`/Invariant text, not the `modified:` array rows O-P42-001 concerns); Session Resume
Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3, fresh pass-44 NEXT against the newly-frozen set, notes full
history 34C→35R→36C→37R→38C→39R→40f→41C→42C→43R, human decision to CONTINUE looping recorded
again; §3 versions updated to v1.17/v1.20/v1.17/v1.34; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress +
Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1100 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last
5 — D-1096 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory
tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-43 (the CONVERGENCE pass) COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (2
MED) + 2 observations (1 fixed, 1 informational).** Both findings are provenance/cross-reference
class — the design substance remains re-confirmed converged (17 consecutive clean passes on the
behavioral core, since pass-27). BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 2/3 → **0/3** — the 4th reset
this session. All four frozen-set artifacts bumped (ADR-046 v1.17, BC-4.17.001 v1.20, BC-5.40.001
v1.17, BC-7.07.001 v1.34); ARCH-INDEX v3.87; BC-INDEX v5.09; input-hashes recomputed for all four.
Fresh pass-44 is the documented NEXT action, starting a new streak toward literal 3-CLEAN against
the newly-frozen set.

## D-1101

**D-1101-ADR046-PASS44-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-OBSERVATION-FIX**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1100 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1101 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 44 dispatched against the newly-frozen set
produced by the pass-43 fix burst (ADR-046 v1.17 + BC-4.17.001 v1.20 + BC-5.40.001 v1.17 +
BC-7.07.001 v1.34). **VERDICT: NO BLOCKER/HIGH/MED findings; ONE non-blocking LOW observation
(O-P44-001), FIXED this burst by governance choice (not required for streak).** The adversary
explicitly characterized the reviewed set as "substantively CONVERGED" and stated the
observation "does not reset a clean streak." The behavioral core was independently re-verified
CLEAN for the 18th consecutive pass (since pass-27).

**O-P44-001 (LOW, POLICY 4/5, illustrative-quote misattribution, fixed).** BC-5.40.001's v1.17
`last_amended` disposition prose (the entry recording the pass-43 F-P43-001 `capabilities.md`
`inputs:` fix) illustrated the newly-added citation with a parenthetical purporting to quote
CAP-031's verbatim description text, but the quoted phrase — "this BC defines the authoritative
lock state data structure..." — was in fact this BC's OWN Capability Anchor Justification
prose, not any text appearing in capabilities.md's CAP-031 entry. Ground truth
(`.factory/specs/domain-spec/capabilities.md` §CAP-031): the capability's actual verbatim
description opens "Enforce single-writer cross-session exclusivity on factory-artifacts state."
Sibling-parity check (in-scope, this pass): BC-4.17.001 v1.20's own analogous illustrative quote
("TTL is 45 minutes with mid-burst renewal") and BC-7.07.001 v1.34's own analogous illustrative
quote (CAP-032's title) were both independently re-verified against their cited CAP's actual
text in capabilities.md and confirmed CORRECT — neither sibling required an edit; only
BC-5.40.001 carried the misattribution. Fixed same-burst by product-owner: BC-5.40.001
v1.17→v1.18; `capabilities.md` remains correctly listed in `inputs:` (that substance is
unchanged — only the illustrative quote-snippet inside the dated historical prose is
corrected). No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered (append-only numbering preserved — POLICY 1).

**Fix-vs-accept governance call (in-scope, this pass — distinct from the O-P42-001 precedent at
D-1099).** Unlike O-P42-001 (a pre-existing, pre-ADR-046, dated-historical `modified:` array
asymmetry, correctly ACCEPTED-and-tracked at D-1099 because fixing it mid-2/3-streak would have
broken the byte-unchanged invariant the 2/3 streak then depended on, forfeiting 2 already-banked
clean passes for a pre-existing item unrelated to that burst), O-P44-001 is: (a) a FRESH
misattribution introduced in OUR OWN pass-43 remediation prose this session (not inherited
pre-existing history), (b) a defect the two sibling BCs' own equivalent prose got RIGHT,
evidencing the correct pattern was known and simply not followed here, and (c) found while the
streak was ALREADY at 0/3 (pass-43's FINDINGS reset had already spent the streak before this
pass ran) — so fixing it costs ZERO additional streak, unlike a fix mid-2/3-streak which would
cost 2 already-banked clean passes. Under CLAUDE.md's production-grade default (Canonical
Principle Rule 4 — AI-built defects are the AI's responsibility to fix; the default action is to
FIX in scope, not defer), the correct governance call here is FIX, not accept-and-track.

**Streak effect: STAYS at 0/3 — does NOT advance to 1/3.** Editing BC-5.40.001 changes the
frozen set pass-44 reviewed; per BC-5.39.001's literal-3-CLEAN discipline, a clean-pass
streak-advance can only be claimed against a set that stays BYTE-UNCHANGED through the review.
Because the fix supersedes the exact bytes pass-44 evaluated, pass-44's clean read does not
carry forward into a continuing streak — it is recorded as a governance-fix pass, not a counted
clean pass (it also does not count as a RESET — zero BLOCKING findings occurred). A FRESH
3-clean count begins at pass-45, against the newly-corrected set (ADR-046 v1.17 + BC-4.17.001
v1.20 + BC-5.40.001 v1.18 + BC-7.07.001 v1.34).

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** BC-INDEX v5.09→**v5.10** (BC-5.40.001 row
version-chain cell +v1.18 appended). ARCH-INDEX v3.87, STORY-INDEX v4.391, and VP-INDEX v2.79
UNCHANGED (only BC-5.40.001 touched this burst — no ADR/story/VP content changed).

**Input-hash recompute:** BC-5.40.001 only (the sole artifact edited this burst): `b711178` →
`e5499da`, confirmed via `compute-input-hash --check`/`--update` round-trip (exit 0 post-update).
ADR-046/BC-4.17.001/BC-7.07.001 input-hashes UNCHANGED — this burst does not re-enter the
[D-1082] 4-artifact cyclic tangle, since only one of the four cluster artifacts was edited this
burst (no cross-citation shift propagates to the other three).

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, decision-log.md for
any stale reference to "pass-43" as the current/NEXT pass or to a streak value other than the
correct `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1082..D-1100 entries correctly
describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak values) and this same burst's own new
content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3 UNCHANGED (governance-fix pass, not a counted clean pass, not a
reset); Current Artifact Versions BC-5.40.001 v1.18 (ADR-046 v1.17/BC-4.17.001 v1.20/BC-7.07.001
v1.34 unchanged); Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-44
fix-and-stay-at-0/3, fresh pass-45 NEXT against the newly-corrected set); Drift Items: two new
lessons recorded — (a) illustrative-quote verbatim-source-accuracy discipline (ninth
convergence-technique discipline), checked via sibling-parity across all cluster disposition
narratives, and (b) `[convergence-governance]` fix-vs-accept disposition rule for a fresh,
in-session, sibling-confirmed-correctable LOW observation at 0/3 (distinct from the D-1099
accept-and-track precedent for pre-existing out-of-perimeter items); O-P42-001 stays tracked,
UNCHANGED, unaffected by this burst; Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3, fresh
pass-45 NEXT against the newly-corrected set, notes full history
34C→35R→36C→37R→38C→39R→40f→41C→42C→43R→44-obs-fixed, human decision to CONTINUE looping
recorded again; §3 versions updated to BC-5.40.001 v1.18; §7 resume command updated); Phase
Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1101 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep
only the last 5 — D-1097 row archived off, already fully preserved in
decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst —
→1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-44 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: NO BLOCKING FINDINGS; 1 LOW
observation (O-P44-001), FIXED (governance choice, zero streak cost at 0/3).** Behavioral core
independently re-verified CLEAN for the 18th consecutive pass (since pass-27). BC-5.40.001
v1.17→v1.18; BC-INDEX v5.09→v5.10; input-hash recomputed. **Streak STAYS 0/3** — the fix
supersedes the exact set pass-44 reviewed, so a fresh 3-clean count begins at pass-45 against
the newly-corrected set. Fresh pass-45 is the documented NEXT action.

## D-1102

**D-1102-ADR046-PASS45-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1101 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1102 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 45 dispatched against the newly-corrected
set produced by the pass-44 governance-fix burst (ADR-046 v1.17 + BC-4.17.001 v1.20 +
BC-5.40.001 v1.18 + BC-7.07.001 v1.34). **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any severity, zero
observations.** Every code-vs-spec claim, cross-BC section anchor, 4-leg version parity,
story-anchor cardinality, status/lifecycle pairing, subsystem label, the ADR §Decision/§N.M
anchor-correctness dimension (D-1092/pass-35), the self-attested cardinality/completeness-claim
dimension (D-1094/pass-37), the arm-parity what-vs-how reconciliation dimension
(D-1096/pass-39), the extended sibling-sweep-includes-VPs locus-class-completeness dimension
(D-1097/pass-40), the grep-complete all-cluster-artifacts `inputs:` audit (D-1100/pass-43), the
AC-owning-artifact cross-reference discipline (D-1100/pass-43, AC-018 → S-18.04a re-derived and
confirmed correct), AND the newly-codified illustrative-quote verbatim-source-accuracy +
sibling-parity-check dimension (D-1101/pass-44, ninth discipline) were all independently
re-verified TRUE against source — including a fresh re-derivation of BC-5.40.001's own
newly-corrected v1.18 CAP-031 citation and both sibling BCs' equivalent CAP-031/CAP-032 quotes,
all three confirmed verbatim-correct against `capabilities.md`. **This is the first pass to run
against the exact set the pass-44 governance-fix burst produced — the cleanest set this gate has
produced across all 45 passes: zero findings, zero observations of any kind.** **BC-5.39.001
3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3.** Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-45.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen
set is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.17 / BC-4.17.001 v1.20 / BC-5.40.001 v1.18 / BC-7.07.001 v1.34.
No version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole
content is: persist the pass-45 record, advance the streak counter, and codify the confirmation
that the ninth discipline (illustrative-quote verbatim-source-accuracy + sibling-parity-check,
D-1101) holds under independent fresh-context re-derivation, together with every dimension this
gate has ever codified.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-45 re-applied every now-codified
convergence-technique discipline proactively from the start, including the ninth discipline
whose discovery caused the immediately preceding burst's governance-fix disposition. Zero
findings, zero observations, on any dimension. **CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged
`[convergence-progress]`): this is the first direct evidence that the ninth discipline, applied
proactively, closes the class it targets the way the prior eight closed theirs — evidence, not
yet proof (one pass); 2 further consecutive clean passes (46, 47) are required to confirm this
holds under BC-5.39.001's literal 3-CLEAN standard.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.10, ARCH-INDEX
v3.87, VP-INDEX v2.79, STORY-INDEX v4.391 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046, BC-4.17.001, BC-5.40.001 `e5499da`, BC-7.07.001) remain valid and
unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-44" as the current/NEXT pass or to
a streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED
HISTORICAL rows (D-1082..D-1101 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass
numbers/streak values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, first clean pass against the pass-44-corrected
set); Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.17, BC-4.17.001 v1.20, BC-5.40.001 v1.18,
BC-7.07.001 v1.34); Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3, pass-45 CLEAN, fresh
pass-46 NEXT); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 1/3, fresh pass-46 NEXT against the
unchanged frozen set, history appends 45C; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated);
Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1102 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to
keep only the last 5 — D-1097 row archived off, already fully preserved in
decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst —
→1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-45 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings, zero
observations, at any severity.** This is the first clean pass against the pass-44-corrected set —
the cleanest set this gate has produced across all 45 passes. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak
ADVANCES 0/3 → **1/3**. No spec artifact edited; no version bump; no input-hash recompute; no
4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-46 is the documented NEXT action against the SAME unchanged frozen
set; needs 2 more consecutive clean passes (46, 47) for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1103

**D-1103-ADR046-PASS46-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1102 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1103 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 46 dispatched against the SAME unchanged
frozen set re-confirmed CLEAN at pass-45 (ADR-046 v1.17 + BC-4.17.001 v1.20 + BC-5.40.001 v1.18
+ BC-7.07.001 v1.34). **VERDICT: FINDINGS (2 MED).** Both findings are provenance/cross-
reference/citation-accuracy class, not behavioral-core defects — the gate's design substance
remains re-confirmed converged for the 20th consecutive pass (stable since pass-27).

**F-P46-001 (MED, POLICY 4, byte-range/body-confinement arm-scope reconciliation).**
BC-4.17.001 Invariant 5's headline ("body never read or parsed") was an un-caveated byte-range
claim contradicting the arm-scope reconciliation already applied to sibling loci (Precondition
4, Invariant 7, VP-TBD-8, PC4, Invariant 9) at v1.18/v1.19 (F-P39-001/F-P40-001) — the hook's
single `host::read_file` call reads the WHOLE file (body included), and PC2's `Renewed`
outcome's single composed `host::write_file` rewrites the WHOLE file back; "operates only
within the frontmatter region" is, for the `expires_at` arm, a semantic-region guarantee, not a
byte-range restriction. Its "Mirrors BC-4.13.001 Invariant 9" citation also imported
BC-4.13.001's byte-range `read_prefix` (read-only, envelope-bounded) semantics without the
reader-vs-writer caveat this hook's `host::read_file` (whole-file writer) call requires. The
pass-40 sweep had listed Invariant 5 as "checked," but that self-attestation recorded only that
the locus was inspected, not WHY it was judged correct — it was still carrying the
pre-F-P39-001 framing underneath the "checked" label. **Mandatory exhaustive byte-range/body-
confinement locus audit performed:** every Precondition/Postcondition/Invariant/VP/
Architecture-Anchor/Edge-Case/Description/§SDK-Grounding-Evidence locus making a byte-range/
body-confinement/frontmatter-only/`read_prefix`-vs-`read_file` claim was enumerated and
verdicted — Precondition 4, Invariant 7 (incl. fence-not-located tail), PC4, and VP-TBD-8 all
re-confirmed CORRECT and unmodified; every other locus confirmed either semantic-region-only
(true under both arms) or unrelated to byte-range/body-confinement entirely. **Invariant 5 was
the ONLY locus still carrying the un-caveated byte-range framing — the class is now fully
drained.** Fixed same-burst by product-owner: Invariant 5 restated with the same arm-split as
its siblings; headline corrected from "body never read" to "body never PARSED, inspected, or
depended on"; the BC-4.13.001 mirror-citation corrected to note the mirror is on
semantic-region intent, not byte-range read mechanism. No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered
(append-only numbering preserved — POLICY 1). BC-4.17.001 v1.20→v1.21.

**F-P46-002 (MED, POLICY 4, cross-reference integrity).** ADR-046 cited "BC-5.40.001 Invariant
2/AC-007" in two live-body loci (§Rationale, §Source/Origin) as though AC-007 were a normative
acceptance-criterion section of BC-5.40.001 itself — but BC-5.40.001 has no Acceptance Criteria
section and no AC-NNN numbering scheme at all (confirmed by a full section-heading sweep), the
same fact this ADR's own pass-43 remediation (F-P43-002) already established for
BC-7.07.001/AC-018, now recurring on a sibling artifact. AC-007 is in fact a STORY-level
acceptance criterion of `.factory/stories/S-17.01-factory-lock-schema-cas-push.md`. Additionally,
§Rationale's parenthetical "MUST NOT be overridden via environment or arguments" was presented
as a verbatim quote but is not verbatim-present anywhere in this repository (confirmed by a
repo-wide `grep -rn` sweep of `.factory/` returning only this ADR's own two loci as hits) —
fabricated at some point in this ADR's own drafting/revision history. **Mandatory exhaustive
AC-reference audit performed** (grep-complete sweep of every `AC-[0-9]+` token across the
document body): found exactly two other AC-NNN loci in the live body, both AC-018, both already
correctly attributed to S-18.04a by the pass-43 fix and requiring no further change. Fixed
same-burst by architect: both AC-007 loci re-expressed as S-17.01's AC-007, anchored to
BC-5.40.001 Invariant 2 rather than implied as the BC's own AC-NNN — §Rationale now cites a
verbatim quote from BC-5.40.001 Invariant 2 ("The TTL value is not configurable by users.") in
place of the fabricated quote; §Source/Origin now reads "Invariant 2 (`TTL_SECONDS = 2700`
non-configurable; also S-17.01's AC-007)." No Decision content, File-Change Plan, or other
Companion Amendment item touched. No new Decision added; Decision numbering (1–6) unchanged;
Status remains **accepted**. ADR-046 v1.17→v1.18.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 1/3 → 0/3 — the 5th reset this session** (after pass-35,
pass-37, pass-39, pass-43). Both findings are UNSWEPT SIBLINGS of prior fixes — F-P46-001 is
the byte-range class's last un-caveated locus (missed by the pass-40 sweep's self-attested-but-
unexplained "checked" verdict); F-P46-002 is the AC-reference class's second instance (the
pass-43 fix only swept BC-7.07.001/AC-018, the locus that finding itself named, not every
AC-NNN reference cluster-wide) — confined to the provenance/cross-reference/citation-accuracy
perimeter, qualitatively closer to the pass-35/pass-43 resets than the pass-39 data-destructive
reset. The behavioral core (write-composition, five-outcome table, identity-gating,
event-sourcing) remains independently re-verified CLEAN, stable for 20 consecutive passes
(since pass-27). Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-46.md`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** ARCH-INDEX v3.87→**v3.88** (ADR-046 row
version cell + pass-44..46 narrative summary appended). BC-INDEX v5.10→**v5.11** (BC-4.17.001
row version-chain cell appended). STORY-INDEX v4.391 and VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (no story or
VP touched this burst).

**Input-hash recompute:** performed via `compute-input-hash --update` for both edited
artifacts (ADR-046, BC-4.17.001), in that edit order — the settling order established at
D-1100. Final stored values: ADR-046 `6110700`, BC-4.17.001 `efa4c8a`. Because BC-4.17.001
cites ADR-046.md as an input, and ADR-046 cites BC-4.17.001.md as an input, updating ADR-046
first then BC-4.17.001 means BC-4.17.001's stored hash settles EXACTLY against its own current
inputs (including ADR-046's just-written content); ADR-046's own stored hash carries an
accepted 1-hop residual drift relative to BC-4.17.001's later same-burst edit — consistent with
the D-1100/D-1101 precedent ("1-hop residual drift — accepted, NOT chased further"). BC-5.40.001
(`e5499da`) and BC-7.07.001 (`d4b0881`) confirmed byte-unchanged this burst, unaffected by the
cyclic tangle since neither was edited. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT
force-converged.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-45" as the current/NEXT pass or to
a streak value other than the correct post-reset `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED
HISTORICAL rows (D-1082..D-1102 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass
numbers/streak values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**0/3** (RESETS, 5th reset this session); Current Artifact
Versions ADR-046 v1.18, BC-4.17.001 v1.21, BC-5.40.001 v1.18 (unchanged), BC-7.07.001 v1.34

confinement class now recorded DRAINED (F-P46-001); AC-reference class now recorded DRAINED for
the two-instance cluster identified so far (F-P46-002); O-P42-001 stays tracked, unaffected;
Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3, fresh pass-47 NEXT against the newly-frozen
set, history appends 46R: 34C→35R→36C→37R→38C→39R→40f→41C→42C→43R→44obsfix→45C→46R; §3 versions

row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail
unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-46 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (2 MED), both fixed
same-burst.** Both findings are unswept-sibling instances of already-codified discipline
classes (byte-range/body-confinement arm-scope; AC-owning-artifact cross-reference) — the
design substance remains re-confirmed converged (20 consecutive clean passes on the behavioral
core, since pass-27). BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 1/3 → **0/3** — the 5th reset this
session. ADR-046 v1.18; BC-4.17.001 v1.21; ARCH-INDEX v3.88; BC-INDEX v5.11; input-hashes

**D-1104-ADR046-PASS47-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1103 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1104 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 47 dispatched against the newly-frozen
set produced by the pass-46 fix burst (ADR-046 v1.18 + BC-4.17.001 v1.21 + BC-5.40.001 v1.18 +
BC-7.07.001 v1.34). **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED).** The finding is the direct cluster-sibling of
the pass-46 fix (F-P46-002) — a provenance/cross-reference/citation-accuracy defect, not a

2700 seconds, non-configurable — is UNCHANGED)" — carried the identical mis-scoping pattern the
pass-46 fix (F-P46-002) already corrected on ADR-046's own AC-007 citation: it presented AC-007
as though it were an acceptance criterion belonging to BC-5.40.001 itself, when BC-5.40.001 has
no Acceptance Criteria section and no AC-NNN numbering scheme at all. AC-007 is in fact a
STORY-level acceptance criterion of `.factory/stories/S-17.01-factory-lock-schema-cas-push.md`,
tracing to BC-5.40.001 Invariant 2. The pass-46 fix corrected ADR-046's own two AC-007 loci but
was scoped only to ADR-046 — it did not trigger a cluster-wide sweep of the two companion BCs
for the same pattern, so this BC's own live-body AC-007 citation survived unaudited into this
pass. **Mandatory cluster-wide exhaustive live-body AC-reference audit performed** (in-scope,
this pass, extending the pass-43/pass-46 single-artifact-scoped audits to all three cluster BCs
at once): BC-4.17.001 had ONE live-body hit (Invariant 3's AC-007, this finding); BC-5.40.001
had SIX AC-NNN hits, all either dated historical narrative or live-body `§Verification
Properties`/`§VP Anchors` rows already correctly scoped to S-19.08 (AC-001..AC-005), no edit
made; BC-7.07.001 had FOUR AC-018 hits, all dated historical narrative already correctly
resolved to S-18.04a at pass-43, no edit made. **BC-4.17.001's Invariant 3 was the ONLY
remaining live-body mis-anchor across all three cluster BCs — the AC-attribution class is now
DRAINED cluster-wide.** Fixed same-burst by product-owner: Invariant 3's parenthetical corrected
to "(BC-5.40.001 §Invariant 2 — 2700 seconds, non-configurable; also S-17.01's AC-007 — is
UNCHANGED)", mirroring the pass-46 ADR-046 remedy exactly. No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered
(append-only numbering preserved — POLICY 1). BC-4.17.001 v1.21→v1.22.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak STAYS 0/3** (already 0/3 from pass-46's reset; this finding keeps
it there — there is no lower floor than 0/3). The finding is an UNSWEPT SIBLING of the pass-46
fix — the class is now confirmed genuinely DRAINED cluster-wide across all four frozen-set
artifacts (ADR-046 drained at pass-46; all three companion BCs drained this pass). The
behavioral core (write-composition, five-outcome table, identity-gating, event-sourcing) remains
independently re-verified CLEAN, stable for 21 consecutive passes (since pass-27). Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-47.md`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** BC-INDEX v5.11→**v5.12** (BC-4.17.001 row
version-chain cell appended). ARCH-INDEX v3.88 UNCHANGED (ADR-046 not touched this pass).
STORY-INDEX v4.391 and VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (no story or VP touched this burst).

**Input-hash recompute:** `compute-input-hash --check`/`--update` run for BC-4.17.001 —
confirmed already current at `efa4c8a`, no update needed. Only BC-4.17.001 was edited this
burst; none of its `inputs:`-listed dependencies (ADR-046, BC-5.40.001, BC-7.07.001,
capabilities.md, BC-4.13.001, BC-6.23.001, the crate sources, hooks-registry.toml) changed
content this pass, so the stored hash remains correctly settled. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]`
UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT force-converged — cross-referenced per this burst's instruction to
settle without reopening.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-46" as the current/NEXT pass or to
a streak value other than the correct post-pass-47 `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED

→1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

**CODIFICATION — unifying meta-lesson (new, this burst):** the AC-attribution class survived
three passes (43, 46, 47) because each fix's own audit was scoped to the SINGLE artifact its
finding named (pass-43: BC-7.07.001 only; pass-46: ADR-046 only), never sweeping the OTHER
cluster artifacts in the same burst. Pass-47's CLUSTER-WIDE audit (all three companion BCs swept
in one pass) found the last straggler (BC-4.17.001 Invariant 3) and drained the class. CODIFIED:
ANY class-draining grep audit (inputs-completeness, AC-references, byte-range/arm-scope, BC↔BC/
ADR cross-anchors, verbatim-quotes) MUST sweep ALL cluster artifacts (ADR-046 + all 3 companion
BCs) in the SAME burst — not just the artifact where the finding originally surfaced.
Single-artifact-scoped audits leave cluster-sibling stragglers that resurface as findings in
later passes, resetting or holding the streak down. This is the recurring ROOT CAUSE identified
across the pass-43/46/47 sequence — audit scope was per-artifact, not per-cluster; the fix is to
make cluster-wide scope the DEFAULT for every future class-draining audit at this gate,
regardless of which single artifact a finding happens to name.

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-47 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED), fixed
same-burst.** The finding is the direct cluster-sibling of the pass-46 fix, closed via a
mandatory cluster-wide exhaustive live-body AC-reference audit — the AC-attribution class is now
confirmed genuinely DRAINED cluster-wide across all four frozen-set artifacts. BC-5.39.001
3-CLEAN streak **STAYS 0/3** (already at floor from pass-46's reset). BC-4.17.001 v1.22;
BC-INDEX v5.12; ADR-046/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED. Fresh pass-48 is the documented NEXT
action, against the newly-frozen set, with the AC-attribution class and the new
cluster-wide-audit-scope discipline both applied proactively from the start.

## D-1105

**D-1105-ADR046-PASS48-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1104 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1105 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 48 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.18 + BC-4.17.001 v1.22 + BC-5.40.001 v1.18 + BC-7.07.001 v1.34). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(1 MED + 1 LOW observation), both fixed same-burst.** Both items are the fourth and fifth
instances of the recurring META pattern (first pass-37, then pass-44): the remediation's OWN
disposition/summary prose is itself attack surface. Neither touches the behavioral core, which
remains re-confirmed converged for the 22nd consecutive pass (stable since pass-27).

**F-P48-001 (MED, POLICY 4, false-fabrication provenance claim).** ADR-046's own v1.18
disposition prose (frontmatter `last_amended` nested v1.18 entry + `## Changelog` v1.18 row)
falsely claimed the quote "MUST NOT be overridden via environment or arguments" was FABRICATED —
"not verbatim-present anywhere in this repository" — on the strength of a `grep -rn` sweep that
was mis-scoped to `.factory/` only and never searched `plugins/`. VERIFIED via a TRUE repo-wide
grep this pass: the phrase IS verbatim-present in `plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/factory-lock-write.sh`
(its `TTL_SECONDS` header comment) — an ADR-046 `inputs:`-listed file. So the phrase was
INHERITED from `factory-lock-write.sh`, not fabricated. Resolved by architect: both v1.18 loci
corrected to state the accurate provenance and the pass-46 grep's mis-scoping root cause. The
v1.18 disposition's LIVE-BODY correction itself (AC-007 re-attributed to S-17.01, BC-5.40.001
Invariant 2 quoted verbatim in §Rationale/§Source-Origin) was independently re-verified accurate
and left UNCHANGED — only the provenance claim was wrong. ADR-046 v1.18→v1.19.

**O-P48-001 (LOW, POLICY 4, under-inclusive exhaustive-enumeration claim, FIXED).** BC-7.07.001's
Description used "only" to enumerate exit-0 conditions as success/no-op/STATE.md-unreadable, but
Precondition 4's worktree-discovery-failure/split-tree-mismatch paths and Postcondition 9's
hook-crash-under-`on_error=continue` path also exit 0 (fail-open) and were omitted. A mandatory
within-artifact sweep for sibling under-inclusive enumeration claims additionally found
Postcondition 8's own closing sentence restating the identical under-inclusive exit-0 list inside
the NORMATIVE Postconditions section. Resolved by product-owner: Description expanded to the full
enumeration; Postcondition 8's closing sentence expanded identically. BC-7.07.001 v1.34→v1.35.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak STAYS 0/3** (already 0/3 from pass-46's reset — the MEDIUM finding
alone is sufficient to keep it there; the LOW observation's fix-vs-accept disposition follows the
D-1101 convergence-governance rule identically to O-P44-001's precedent, zero incremental streak
cost). Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-48.md`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** ARCH-INDEX v3.88→**v3.89** (ADR-046 row
version-chain cell appended — pass-47-unchanged note + pass-48 fix note). BC-INDEX
v5.12→**v5.13** (BC-7.07.001 row version-chain cell appended — v1.35 entry). STORY-INDEX v4.391
and VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED (no story or VP touched this burst).

**Input-hash recompute (cyclic-hash TD [D-1082] — settled, NOT reopened):** `compute-input-hash`
run for both edited artifacts via the sanctioned `--check`/`--update` tool. ADR-046 and
BC-7.07.001 mutually cite each other in `inputs:`, so updating one changes the other's computed
hash — the same non-converging cascade [D-1082] already documents. Settled by running each
artifact's `--update` in turn and accepting the resulting state per the established convention
(one artifact SETTLED against the other's final content, the other carrying an accepted 1-hop
residual, exactly mirroring pass-46's "ADR-046 1-hop residual accepted; BC-... settled"
disposition): **BC-7.07.001 input-hash `d4b0881`→`f4ecc70` (SETTLED — matches its own `--check`
against ADR-046's final v1.19 content, verified via literal shell, exit 0)**. **ADR-046
input-hash `6110700`→`1e9016d` (1-HOP RESIDUAL ACCEPTED — a subsequent `--check` computes
`bc51158` because BC-7.07.001's own final content, hashed as one of ADR-046's inputs, changed
after ADR-046's own hash was last written; per [D-1082] this is the known non-convergent
ping-pong, not re-chased further this burst, cross-referenced not reopened)**.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-47" as the current/NEXT pass or to
a streak value other than the correct post-pass-48 `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED
HISTORICAL rows (D-1057..D-1104 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass
numbers/streak values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched
this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

**CODIFICATION — two new lessons + one meta lesson (this burst):** (a) VERBATIM-ABSENCE claims —
any "fabricated"/"not present anywhere"/"verbatim-absent" assertion in disposition prose MUST be
backed by a TRUE repository-wide grep (all `inputs:` files including `plugins/` and `crates/`,
not just `.factory/`), and MUST state the scope of the grep performed; the pass-46 mis-scoped
grep produced a false "fabricated" claim, the root cause of F-P48-001. (b) SUMMARY-ENUMERATION
claims — Description/overview "only"/"exclusively"/exhaustive enumerations must match the
normative Preconditions/Postconditions body exactly; any such claim requires a within-artifact
sweep for sibling stragglers, per O-P48-001's own sweep finding the Postcondition 8 sibling.
(c) META — the recurring pattern of "the remediation's OWN disposition prose contains a false or
inaccurate claim" (F-P37-001 decision-count, O-P44-001 misattributed quote, F-P48-001 false-
fabrication, O-P48-001 under-inclusive enumeration) confirms a fix's changelog/last_amended
prose is itself attack surface — keep it MINIMAL and verify every factual claim in it before
writing, rather than assuming a prior pass's grep or paraphrase was accurate.

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-48 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED + 1 LOW
observation), both fixed same-burst.** F-P48-001 corrected a false-fabrication provenance claim
in ADR-046's own v1.18 disposition prose (root cause: pass-46's grep was `.factory/`-scoped, not
repo-wide); O-P48-001 corrected an under-inclusive exit-0 enumeration in BC-7.07.001's
Description plus its Postcondition 8 sibling straggler. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **STAYS 0/3**
(already at floor from pass-46's reset). ADR-046 v1.19; BC-7.07.001 v1.35; ARCH-INDEX v3.89;
BC-INDEX v5.13; BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001 UNCHANGED. Fresh pass-49 is the documented NEXT action,
against the newly-frozen set, with two new codified disciplines (repo-wide-absence-grep,
summary-enumeration-accuracy) applied proactively from the start.

**D-1106-ADR046-PASS49-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1105 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1106 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 49 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.19 + BC-4.17.001 v1.22 + BC-5.40.001 v1.18 + BC-7.07.001 v1.35). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(1 MED), fixed same-burst, plus 6 audit-extra cluster-wide inputs stragglers found and fixed via
the mandatory re-audit this finding triggered (7 total).** The behavioral core remains
re-confirmed converged for the 23rd consecutive pass (stable since pass-27) — this finding is
confined entirely to the `inputs:`-completeness perimeter.

**F-P49-001 (MED, POLICY 18, inputs:-completeness).** ADR-046's own v1.19 disposition prose — the
F-P48-001 fix that re-attributed AC-007 to S-17.01 and quoted BC-5.40.001 Invariant 2 verbatim in
§Rationale/§Source-Origin — quoted S-17.01's AC-007 verbatim without adding
`.factory/stories/S-17.01-factory-lock-schema-cas-push.md` to ADR-046's own `inputs:`. This is a
FRESH straggler CREATED by the pass-46/48 AC-007 re-attribution edits themselves, not a
pre-existing gap any prior audit could have caught (the citation did not exist before pass-46). A
mandatory grep-complete inputs RE-AUDIT (triggered by this finding, per the newly-codified
CITATION→INPUT PARITY discipline) additionally found ADR-046's own §Companion Amendment 3 citing
S-18.04a verbatim since pass-43's F-P43-002 fix, likewise never added to `inputs:`. Resolved by
architect: both `.factory/stories/S-17.01-factory-lock-schema-cas-push.md` and
`.factory/stories/S-18.04a-precompact-flush-sh-core.md` added to `inputs:`; bracket-balance of
`last_amended` re-verified 27/27 unchanged. ADR-046 v1.19→v1.20.

**Audit-extra findings (product-owner, cluster-wide re-audit across all three companion BCs, same

Invariant 5's BC-1.17.001 citation were both missing from `inputs:`; added, BC-4.17.001
v1.22→v1.23. BC-5.40.001 — §Verification Properties/§VP Anchors' S-19.08 attribution was missing
from `inputs:`; added, BC-5.40.001 v1.18→v1.19. BC-7.07.001 — PC4/Architecture Anchors'
`plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/factory-lock-write.sh` citation and Related BCs' BC-7.07.002 citation
were both missing from `inputs:`; added, BC-7.07.001 v1.35→v1.36. 5 stragglers across the 3 BCs +
1 additional ADR-046 straggler (S-18.04a) + F-P49-001's own S-17.01 fix = 7 total
citation-without-input stragglers drained cluster-wide this burst.

BC-5.40.001→BC-7.07.001 (last-updated artifact settles against the other three's final content;
the other three each carry a 1-hop residual since a sibling changed after their own hash was
written — this is the same non-convergent ping-pong [D-1082] documents, now expected to produce

as passes 43-48's AC-007 re-attributions) can re-open the gap even after a prior audit passed
clean — mandating a periodic CLUSTER-WIDE re-audit after any such run, not merely a one-time
audit treated as permanently valid.

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-49 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED), fixed same-burst,
plus 6 audit-extra cluster-wide inputs stragglers found and fixed.** F-P49-001 closed a fresh
citation-without-input straggler on ADR-046 (S-17.01), created by the pass-46/48 AC-007
re-attribution; the triggered cluster-wide re-audit found and fixed 6 more of the identical class
across ADR-046 (S-18.04a) and all three companion BCs. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **STAYS 0/3**
(already at floor from pass-46's reset). ADR-046 v1.20; BC-4.17.001 v1.23; BC-5.40.001 v1.19;
BC-7.07.001 v1.36; ARCH-INDEX v3.90; BC-INDEX v5.14. Fresh pass-50 is the documented NEXT action,
against the newly-frozen set, with the new CITATION→INPUT PARITY (fourteenth) discipline applied
proactively from the start.

## D-1107

**D-1107-ADR046-PASS50-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1106 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1107 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 50 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.20 + BC-4.17.001 v1.23 + BC-5.40.001 v1.19 + BC-7.07.001 v1.36). **VERDICT: FINDINGS
(2 MED), both fixed same-burst.** The behavioral core remains re-confirmed converged for the 24th
consecutive pass (stable since pass-27) — both findings are confined to the traceability/
catalog-membership and inputs-completeness perimeters, not the behavioral core.

**F-P50-001 (MED, POLICY 4, false-'verified present' traceability defect).** BC-4.17.001's own
§Story Anchor and ADR-046's own §File-Change Plan asserted S-17.05 — the ADR-046 implementing
story — "verified present in STORY-INDEX.md" / "is its catalog entry." This was FALSE: STORY-INDEX's
E-17 roster ended at S-17.04 (epic marked "COMPLETE"); S-17.05 existed as a drafted story FILE but
was never REGISTERED as a catalog row. The false claim traces to the pass-25 F-P25-002
remediation, which resolved the BC prose's `[pending]`→S-17.05 anchor but never performed the
actual STORY-INDEX membership check the "verified present" wording asserts — the implementing
story was orphaned from the catalog for ~48 passes because no prior audit type (inputs-
completeness, AC-attribution) checks catalog-row EXISTENCE. **Fixed by state-manager**: S-17.05
REGISTERED in STORY-INDEX (v4.391→v4.392) — E-17 roster reconciled (story_count 4→5, points
26→34, waves 1-4→1-5; waves 1-4 remain MERGED/COMPLETE per issue #170, wave 5 draft/pending). This
makes the BC-4.17.001/ADR-046 catalog-presence claim TRUE without editing either frozen-set spec —
the defect was in the catalog, not the citing prose.

**F-P50-002 (MED, POLICY 18, inputs:-completeness — extends the fourteenth discipline to
exact-path story citations).** S-17.05 is cited by exact file path and content claims (§Story
Anchor) in all three companion BCs' live bodies, but was absent from all three BCs' `inputs:`
arrays. This is the CITATION→INPUT PARITY discipline (fourteenth, D-1106) applied to a citation
TYPE its initial codification did not explicitly enumerate (exact-path STORY citations, as
distinct from file/BC/ADR citations). **Fixed by product-owner**: S-17.05 added to `inputs:` in
BC-4.17.001 (v1.23→v1.24), BC-5.40.001 (v1.19→v1.20), BC-7.07.001 (v1.36→v1.37). BC-5.40.001's own
cross-check additionally found and fixed a sibling gap in the same sweep: S-17.01 (cited with
content claims since PR #181/D-544, 2026-06-11) was ALSO missing from BC-5.40.001's `inputs:` —
added same-burst. ADR-046 v1.20 **UNCHANGED** — it already listed S-17.05 in its own `inputs:`;
only the three companion BCs carried this straggler.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak STAYS 0/3** (already 0/3 from pass-46's reset — either MEDIUM finding
alone is sufficient to keep it there). Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-50.md`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** BC-INDEX v5.14→**v5.15** (BC-4.17.001/
BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 row version-chain cells appended — pass-50 fix notes; bracket-delta
self-consistency re-verified, `[Prior:` count 277→278 matched by trailing-bracket run 36→37,
tracked historical delta unchanged at 241). STORY-INDEX v4.391→**v4.392** (bumped by story-writer
this burst — S-17.05 registration, F-P50-001 fix). ARCH-INDEX v3.90 and VP-INDEX v2.79 UNCHANGED
(ADR-046 not edited this pass).

**Input-hash recompute (cyclic-hash TD [D-1082] — settled, NOT reopened; 3 of 4 cluster artifacts
edited this burst, ADR-046 UNCHANGED):** `compute-input-hash` run for the three edited BCs via the
sanctioned `--check`/`--update` tool, in edit order BC-4.17.001→BC-5.40.001→BC-7.07.001
(last-updated artifact settles against the other three's final content; the other two BCs plus
the unedited ADR-046 each carry a 1-hop residual since a sibling changed after their own hash was
last written — the same non-convergent ping-pong [D-1082] documents): **BC-7.07.001 input-hash
`e2062c6`→`673078a` (SETTLED — `--check` exit 0, verified via literal shell)**. **BC-4.17.001
input-hash `bf9748a`→`0edc756` (1-hop residual accepted)**. **BC-5.40.001 input-hash
`7394d84`→`a21ce60` (1-hop residual accepted)**. **ADR-046 input-hash `a07142a` UNCHANGED-in-file
but now stale relative to the 3 edited BCs (1-hop residual, not re-stamped — ADR-046's own body/
frontmatter untouched this burst, per this burst's explicit instruction; cyclic-hash TD [D-1082]
cross-referenced, NOT reopened)**.

**STORY-INDEX stale-aggregate drift (accepted non-blocking, NOT fixed this burst):**
story-writer's own F-P50-001 registration burst flagged that STORY-INDEX's headline "131 stories
across 20 epics" text and its §Status Summary counts are PRE-EXISTING stale drift predating
E-18/E-19/E-21 growth — out of F-P50-001's own perimeter (scoped to E-17's S-17.05 registration
only). Recorded as a NEW tracked Drift Item this burst: anchor is the next maintenance sweep OR a
full STORY-INDEX headline/Status-Summary reconciliation pass, whichever comes first.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, STORY-INDEX.md, STATE.md, ARCH-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-49" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-pass-50 `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1057..D-1106 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**STAYS 0/3** (both findings keep it there); Current Artifact
Versions BC-4.17.001 v1.24, BC-5.40.001 v1.20, BC-7.07.001 v1.37 (ADR-046 v1.20 UNCHANGED);
STORY-INDEX v4.392; BC-INDEX v5.15; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-50
FINDINGS with 2 MED, both fixed, fresh pass-51 NEXT against the newly-frozen set); Drift Items:
the mechanical-catalog-membership-check codification + the STORY-INDEX-stale-aggregate drift note
recorded; O-P42-001 stays tracked, unaffected; Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3,
fresh pass-51 NEXT against the newly-frozen set, history appends 50f:
34C→35R→36C→37R→38C→39R→40f→41C→42C→43R→44obsfix→45C→46R→47f→48f→49f→50f; §3 versions updated to
BC-4.17.001 v1.24 / BC-5.40.001 v1.20 / BC-7.07.001 v1.37 [ADR-046 v1.20 UNCHANGED]); Phase
Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1107 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep
only the last 5 — D-1102 row archived off, already fully preserved in decision-log.md/
burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4
carries forward).

**CODIFICATION — two new lessons this burst (both are distinct disciplines, neither folds into
the other):** (a) a "verified present in STORY-INDEX" / "is its catalog entry" claim in spec prose
MUST be backed by a mechanical STORY-INDEX membership check, not asserted from a BC-prose-only
Traceability fix; mandate: register implementing stories in STORY-INDEX at draft time, and any
story-anchor "present-in-index" assertion requires the membership check. (b) CITATION→INPUT PARITY
(fourteenth discipline, D-1106) is confirmed to extend to exact-path STORY citations, not merely
file/BC/ADR citations — the same same-burst `inputs:` obligation applies.

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-50 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (2 MED), both fixed
same-burst.** F-P50-001 closed a ~48-pass-old false-'verified present in STORY-INDEX' traceability
defect by registering S-17.05 in the catalog (state-manager). F-P50-002 extended the fourteenth
discipline to exact-path story citations, closed by adding S-17.05 (+ S-17.01 sibling gap on
BC-5.40.001) to all three companion BCs' `inputs:` (product-owner). BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak
**STAYS 0/3** (already at floor from pass-46's reset). BC-4.17.001 v1.24; BC-5.40.001 v1.20;
BC-7.07.001 v1.37; ADR-046 v1.20 UNCHANGED; STORY-INDEX v4.392; BC-INDEX v5.15. Fresh pass-51 is
the documented NEXT action, against the newly-frozen set.

## D-1108

**D-1108-ADR046-PASS51-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1107 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1108 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 51 dispatched against the frozen set
(ADR-046 v1.20 + BC-4.17.001 v1.24 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.37). **VERDICT: NO
BLOCKER/HIGH/MED findings; 1 LOW observation (O-P51-001), fixed same-burst.** The behavioral core
remains re-confirmed converged for the 25th consecutive pass (stable since pass-27) — this is the
cleanest pass this gate has produced since the last clean streak (pass-45).

**O-P51-001 (LOW, POLICY 4, illustrative-enumeration imprecision).** ADR-046 §Decision 5's
per-element reconciliation table VP-rows disposition row illustratively enumerated BC-4.17.001's
migrated VP-row analogs as "analogous to T-001/T-002/T-003/T-004/T-007." This was IMPRECISE:
T-002/T-003 are BC-5.40.001's staleness-BLOCK tests with no stamper analog (the always-allow-
and-correct stamper never blocks, so they were never migrated), and T-005
(`extract_frontmatter`/no-delimiter fail-open) was omitted despite being migrated. BC-4.17.001's
own §Verification Properties note cites the exact set "T-001/T-004/T-005/T-007" as the
authoritative migrated-analog basis (VP-TBD-7/8/9) — the sibling BC had it right; only ADR-046's
own illustrative parenthetical carried the imprecise enumeration. **Fixed by architect**: ADR-046
v1.20→v1.21, §Decision 5's enumeration corrected to "T-001/T-004/T-005/T-007," matching
BC-4.17.001's own authoritative basis exactly; a within-artifact T-NNN sweep confirmed all other 6
T-references are accurate — no sibling recurrence. This is a content-defect instance of the
existing NINTH discipline (D-1101, illustrative-content-accuracy + sibling-parity cross-check),
extended from its original verbatim-QUOTE scope to an illustrative "analogous to
<ID-list>"/example ENUMERATION — not a new standalone discipline.

**GOVERNANCE (fix-vs-accept, D-1101 precedent):** the LOW observation was FIXED rather than
accepted/banked as a partial 1/3 streak advance, because at streak-floor 0/3 the fix costs no
streak AND it is a fresh live-body inaccuracy the sibling BC already had correct (not PRESERVED
HISTORICAL content) — same disposition class as O-P44-001.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak STAYS 0/3.** Because ADR-046 was edited this burst (the reviewed set
is no longer the current set), pass-51's own zero-BLOCKER/HIGH/MED result does NOT advance the
streak to 1/3 — the fresh literal-3-CLEAN count begins at pass-52 against the newly-edited set.
Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-51.md`.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** ARCH-INDEX v3.90→**v3.91** (ADR-046 row
bumped v1.20→v1.21; bracket-delta self-consistency re-verified, `[Prior:` count 179→180 matched by
trailing-bracket run 27→28, tracked historical delta unchanged at 152). BC-INDEX v5.15,
STORY-INDEX v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79 all **UNCHANGED** (no companion-BC/story/VP edit this pass).

**Input-hash recompute (cyclic-hash TD [D-1082] — re-triggered again this pass, NOT reopened;
only ADR-046 edited, the 3 companion BCs UNCHANGED-in-file):** `compute-input-hash` run for
ADR-046 via the sanctioned default/`--check` modes, pre- and post-edit: **ADR-046 input-hash
`a07142a`→`cb428ff` (SETTLED — `--check` exit 0 against ADR-046's own post-edit content; no
`--resolve` MISSING inputs found)**. Because ADR-046 is itself listed in each of the 3 companion
BCs' own `inputs:` arrays, editing ADR-046 makes THEIR stored hashes go stale relative to
ADR-046's new v1.21 content even though none of the 3 BC files were touched: `--check` against
each post-edit confirms DRIFT — BC-4.17.001 `0edc756`≠computed`5797021`, BC-5.40.001
`a21ce60`≠computed`ca0f4c5`, BC-7.07.001 `673078a`≠computed`a306463` (all exit 2). This is the same
cyclic ping-pong [D-1082] documents, roles reversed from pass-49/pass-50 (there the BCs were
edited and ADR-046 went stale; here ADR-046 is edited and the 3 BCs go stale). Per established
convention these 3 fresh residuals are ACCEPTED and NOT re-chased this burst; the tangle itself
remains cross-referenced, NOT reopened or force-converged, per standing convention.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, STORY-INDEX.md, STATE.md, ARCH-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-50" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-pass-51 `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1057..D-1107 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**STAYS 0/3** (a spec edit supersedes the clean-of-blockers result;
fresh pass-52 NEXT); Current Artifact Versions ADR-046 v1.21 (BC-4.17.001 v1.24, BC-5.40.001
v1.20, BC-7.07.001 v1.37 all UNCHANGED); ARCH-INDEX v3.91; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row
updated (streak 0/3, pass-51 zero-BLOCKER/HIGH/MED with 1 LOW obs fixed, fresh pass-52 NEXT
against the newly-frozen set); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3, fresh pass-52
NEXT, history appends 51obsfix:

to ADR-046 v1.21 [BCs UNCHANGED]); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1108
(Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1103 row archived off, already
fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched
this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

**CODIFICATION — one new lesson this burst:** illustrative "analogous to T-NNN"/example
enumerations in an ADR must match the authoritative implementing-BC's own basis for the identical
claim (BC-4.17.001 got it right; the ADR parenthetical didn't) — a content-defect-discipline
instance extending the ninth discipline (D-1101) from verbatim quotes to illustrative
enumerations, not a new standalone discipline. **Also META (brief):** pass-51's zero-BLOCKER/
HIGH/MED result confirms the substance (behavioral core, 25 consecutive clean passes since
pass-27) and all fourteen previously-drained/codified metadata-layer disciplines continue holding
— the ONLY defect found was a fresh illustrative-content-accuracy instance, itself an already-
codified discipline class (ninth), not a new failure mode.

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-51 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: NO BLOCKER/HIGH/MED findings; 1 LOW
observation (O-P51-001), fixed same-burst.** O-P51-001 closed an illustrative-enumeration
imprecision in ADR-046's own §Decision 5 disposition prose by architect (v1.20→v1.21), matching
BC-4.17.001's own already-correct basis. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **STAYS 0/3** — the spec edit
supersedes the clean result; fresh literal-3-CLEAN count begins at pass-52. ADR-046 v1.21;
BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 all UNCHANGED; ARCH-INDEX v3.91. Fresh pass-52 is the

## D-1109

**D-1109-ADR046-PASS52-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1108 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1109 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 52 dispatched against the O-P51-001-corrected
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.21 + BC-4.17.001 v1.24 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.37) produced by
the pass-51 fix burst. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any severity.** Every code-vs-spec claim,
cross-BC section anchor, AC→story attribution, 4-leg version parity, cardinality claim,
status/lifecycle pairing, byte-range/body-confinement arm-scope reconciliation, and — most
directly — the illustrative "analogous to T-NNN" enumeration dimension pass-51's own finding
(O-P51-001) targeted, were all independently re-verified TRUE against source. ADR-046 §Decision 5
now correctly reads "T-001/T-004/T-005/T-007," matching BC-4.17.001's own authoritative basis
exactly, with no sibling recurrence found anywhere else in the frozen set. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN
streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3** — the first clean pass against the corrected set, following the pass-51
spec-edit supersession. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-52.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.21 / BC-4.17.001 v1.24 / BC-5.40.001 v1.20 / BC-7.07.001 v1.37. No
version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content
is: persist the pass-52 record, advance the streak counter, and codify the confirmation that all
fifteen now-codified convergence-technique disciplines — including the ninth (D-1101), just
extended at D-1108 to cover illustrative example-enumerations — hold under a fresh adversary's
independent re-derivation.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-52 re-applied all fifteen codified
convergence-technique disciplines proactively from the start, including the dimension whose
correction (O-P51-001) produced this pass's own reviewed set. Zero findings on any dimension.
**CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md, tagged `[convergence-progress]`): this is the first direct
evidence that the ninth discipline's D-1108 extension (illustrative example-enumerations, not only
verbatim quotes) holds under independent fresh-context re-derivation, and that all fourteen prior
disciplines continue holding simultaneously. Evidence, not yet proof (one pass); 2 further
consecutive clean passes (53, 54) are required to confirm this holds under BC-5.39.001's literal
3-CLEAN standard.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.15, STORY-INDEX
v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79, ARCH-INDEX v3.91 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored

Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further — the 3 companion BCs' 1-hop

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-51" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL

## D-1110

**D-1110-ADR046-PASS53-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1109 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1110 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 53 dispatched against the SAME
O-P51-001-corrected frozen set (ADR-046 v1.21 + BC-4.17.001 v1.24 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 +
BC-7.07.001 v1.37) pass-52 also reviewed. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any severity.** Every
code-vs-spec claim, cross-BC section anchor, AC→story attribution, 4-leg version parity,
cardinality claim, status/lifecycle pairing, byte-range/body-confinement arm-scope reconciliation,
and the illustrative "analogous to T-NNN" enumeration dimension were all independently re-verified
TRUE against source, with zero regression across all fifteen previously-codified
convergence-technique disciplines. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 1/3 → 2/3** — the second
CONSECUTIVE clean pass (52, 53) against the unchanged corrected set. Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-53.md`.

**One non-blocking descriptive item considered and DISMISSED as defensible, tracked as
O-P53-DESC-NOOP:** BC-7.07.001 §Description states "Renewal is a no-op when: … or `expires_at` is
malformed (never repaired)," whereas the normative body (Postcondition 3 case 1 / Invariant 3b's
canonical five-case table row 1 / EC-004) specifies the actual return value on a malformed
`expires_at` is a distinct `Err(LockError::Malformed(msg))` — explicitly NOT a `NoOp`/`SkipReason`
value — downgraded to an advisory `log_warn` by the plugin caller. The pass-53 adversary
independently applied the ninth discipline's (D-1101/D-1108) illustrative-content-accuracy lens to
this Description-prose locus and determined the Description's use of "no-op" is a DEFENSIBLE
plain-English characterization of the STATE.md-OBSERVABLE effect (nothing gets written; the field
is left unchanged), not an assertion of the `RenewOutcome::NoOp` Rust enum variant — the
Description's own "(never repaired)" parenthetical is itself the signal that this is prose, not a
type claim. The normative body remains precise and internally self-consistent everywhere it needs
to be (re-verified clean, no defect found there). **This is NOT a POLICY 4 contradiction** — the
Description's substantive claim (no write happens) is TRUE; it is a plain-language summary, not a
type-precision claim, and does not block convergence. **Disposition: ACCEPTED as a tracked
non-blocking descriptive item, NOT fixed this pass** — per the `[convergence-governance]` fix-vs-
accept rule (D-1101), fixing a defensible non-defect mid-streak would cost the live 2/3 streak for
no substantive correctness gain. Anchor: optional Description-precision tightening (e.g., reword to
"results in no change to `expires_at`") at a future non-gating touch. This is governance-consistent
with O-P42-001's accept-and-track disposition (D-1099).

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.21 / BC-4.17.001 v1.24 / BC-5.40.001 v1.20 / BC-7.07.001 v1.37. No
version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content
is: persist the pass-53 record, advance the streak counter, record the O-P53-DESC-NOOP adjudication
as a tracked accepted item, and codify that all fifteen now-codified convergence-technique
disciplines continue holding under a second consecutive fresh adversary's independent
re-derivation.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-53 re-applied all fifteen codified
convergence-technique disciplines proactively from the start and additionally extended the
Description-prose precision lens to a locus not previously checked, correctly distinguishing a
defensible plain-English simplification from a genuine defect. Zero BLOCKING findings; 1
LOW descriptive item considered and dismissed as defensible (not counted as a finding, tracked as
accepted). **CODIFIED this burst** (see lessons.md): at streak 2/3, an adversary-adjudicated-
defensible LOW descriptive item is accepted-and-tracked rather than fixed, since fixing a
defensible non-defect would reset a live convergence streak for no substantive gain — governance
consistent with the O-P42-001 fix-vs-accept precedent (D-1101).

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.15, STORY-INDEX
v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79, ARCH-INDEX v3.91 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `cb428ff`, BC-4.17.001 `0edc756`, BC-5.40.001 `a21ce60`, BC-7.07.001
`673078a`) remain valid and unchanged, confirmed via literal `grep` re-read (burst-log.md Block 5).
Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further — the 3 companion BCs' 1-hop
residuals from pass-51's roles-reversed recompute remain ACCEPTED, unchanged this burst.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-52" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `2/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1057..D-1109 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**2/3** (ADVANCES, second consecutive clean pass); Current Artifact
Versions UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.21, BC-4.17.001 v1.24, BC-5.40.001 v1.20, BC-7.07.001 v1.37);
Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 2/3, pass-53 CLEAN, fresh pass-54 NEXT); Drift
Items gains O-P53-DESC-NOOP (accepted non-blocking descriptive item) alongside O-P42-001 (both
UNCHANGED-status, tracked); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 2/3, fresh pass-54 NEXT
against the unchanged frozen set, history appends 53C; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command
updated — ON CONVERGENCE S-17.05 TDD unblocks); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for
D-1110 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5 — D-1105 row archived off,
already fully preserved in decision-log.md/burst-log.md). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not
touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-53 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any
severity.** This is the second consecutive clean pass against the O-P51-001-corrected set. One
adversary-adjudicated non-blocking descriptive item (O-P53-DESC-NOOP) considered and ACCEPTED as
tracked, not fixed. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 1/3 → **2/3**. No spec artifact edited; no
version bump; no input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-54 is the documented NEXT
action against the SAME unchanged frozen set; needs 1 more consecutive clean pass (54) for literal
3-CLEAN — the CONVERGENCE pass.

## D-1111

**D-1111-ADR046-PASS54-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1110 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1111 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 54 — **the CONVERGENCE pass** (streak
entered this pass at 2/3; one more consecutive clean pass would have reached literal 3-CLEAN) —
dispatched against the SAME O-P51-001-corrected frozen set (ADR-046 v1.21 + BC-4.17.001 v1.24 +
BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.37) passes 52/53 also reviewed. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED) —
F-P54-001, FIXED.** Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-54.md`.

**F-P54-001 (MED, POLICY 15 spec-vs-code + POLICY 4 internal-consistency).** ADR-046
systematically mis-cited `verify-state-timestamp-refresh`'s own module-doc step numbers at four
loci: §Context item 2 and §Rationale's "Why the identity gate on `expires_at`" bullet both labeled
the lock-expiry (`factory_lock.expires_at`) staleness arm "Step 7"; §Decision 5's retirement
paragraph labeled the two arms "Steps 4–6 (timestamp)" and "Step 7 (lock-expiry)"; §Decision 3's
"three current mechanisms corrected to four" bullet also labeled the lock-expiry arm "Step 7".
Ground truth, confirmed by inspection of
`crates/hook-plugins/verify-state-timestamp-refresh/src/lib.rs`'s own module-doc "On each
invocation the guard:" enumeration (its own Step 3a already states "If only `factory_lock:` is set:
skip Steps 4–7; proceed to Step 8"): **Steps 4–7 are the `timestamp:` staleness arm** (Step 4
extract, Step 5 block-if-absent-in-proposed, Step 6 continue-if-absent-on-disk, Step 7
block-if-byte-identical); **Step 8 is the separate `factory_lock.expires_at` staleness arm.**
ADR-046 had the two arms' step-ranges swapped/mislabeled at all four loci; there was also an
internal §Context("Steps 4-8" umbrella)/§Decision-5("Steps 4-6"/"Step 7" split) mutual
inconsistency compounding the defect — the substance (two arms, both retired, functionally
correctly described) was never wrong, only the numeric step-labels were.

**Fixed by architect**, all four loci corrected in the same burst: §Context item 2 → "Step 8
(module-doc Steps 4–8; the lock-expiry arm)"; §Decision 5 → "Steps 4–7 (timestamp staleness block)
and Step 8 (lock-expiry staleness block)"; §Rationale and §Decision 3 → both now cite "Step 8". A
within-artifact grep-complete sweep of every `Step[s] [0-9]` token confirmed these were the ONLY
four loci citing `verify-state-timestamp-refresh`'s own step numbers — no sibling recurrence within
ADR-046 (every other "Step N" citation refers to a different module's own numbering and was already
correct). A parallel check of BC-5.40.001, BC-4.17.001, and BC-7.07.001 for the same mis-citation
pattern found NONE — both BCs' single "Step N" occurrences refer to `factory-lock`/
`precompact-flush`'s own step numbering, not `verify-state-timestamp-refresh`'s, and required no
correction. No Decision content, File-Change Plan, or Companion Amendment item otherwise touched;
Decision numbering (1–6) unchanged; Status remains **accepted**. ADR-046 **v1.21→v1.22**.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak: 2/3 → RESETS to 0/3.** This is the SECOND time this session a
convergence-pass finding has reset a live 2/3 streak (the first was pass-43, D-1101/D-1102/D-1103
range) — in both cases, the finding was a genuine spec-vs-code defect surfaced by a fresh-context
adversary applying a lens no prior pass had used (pass-43: `capabilities.md` inputs-completeness;
pass-54: exact module-doc step-number citation), not a repeat of a previously-cleared class. This
empirically confirms the asymptotic-floor pattern: even after 53 clean/fixed passes, a genuinely
fresh cross-check dimension can still surface exactly one narrow, real defect — supporting the case
for D-386 Option C asymptotic acceptance as a legitimate alternative to chasing literal 3-CLEAN
indefinitely, though the human has again been offered and has again declined accept-provisional
this session (see §5 Pending Human Decision in STATE.md).

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** F-P54-001 is a NEW distinct finding class —
**STEP-NUMBER CITATION** — not an instance of any of the fifteen previously-codified disciplines.
CODIFIED this burst as the **SIXTEENTH** convergence-technique discipline: any "Step N"/"Steps
N-M" citation of a module's own internal enumeration MUST be cross-checked against that module's
actual `//!`/doc-comment step numbering, not merely checked for functional/arm correctness.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** ARCH-INDEX **v3.91→v3.92** (ADR-046 row
bumped v1.21→v1.22, version-stable read-through convention preserved). BC-INDEX v5.15, STORY-INDEX
v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79 all **UNCHANGED** (no companion-BC/story/VP edit this pass).

**Input-hash recompute (cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` — settled + cross-referenced, NOT reopened):**
`compute-input-hash --check` then `--update` run for ADR-046 against its post-edit content:
**CONFIRMED SETTLED, unchanged at `cb428ff`** — no drift. The fix corrected numeric labels attached
to an already-`inputs:`-listed module (`verify-state-timestamp-refresh`); it added no new citation,
so ADR-046's own input-hash (which reflects its LISTED inputs' content, not its own body text) is
unaffected. The 3 companion BCs' own stored hashes (`0edc756`/`a21ce60`/`673078a`) remain at their
existing 1-hop-residual state relative to ADR-046's content — unchanged in kind from the pass-51
disposition, not re-chased, per established `[D-1082]` convention.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-53"/"pass-54" as the current/NEXT
pass, to streak value `2/3`, or to ADR-046 `v1.21` as the live version — matches confined to
PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1057..D-1110 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous
pass numbers/streak/version values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap
found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 2/3→**0/3** (RESETS, second convergence-pass reset this session,
parallel to pass-43); Current Artifact Versions: ADR-046 **v1.22** (BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001/
BC-7.07.001 UNCHANGED); ARCH-INDEX version cell v3.92; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated
(streak 0/3, pass-54 FINDINGS(1 MED)/fixed, fresh pass-55 NEXT); Drift Items gains the
STEP-NUMBER-CITATION `[codified][process-gap]` sixteenth-discipline entry; O-P42-001 and
O-P53-DESC-NOOP stay tracked, UNCHANGED; a new non-blocking Drift note records 2 architect Bash
python3-write ATTEMPTS blocked by the sandbox before recovery via Edit (non-blocking, no bypass
occurred); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3, fresh pass-55 NEXT against the
newly-frozen v1.22 set, history appends 54R noting 52C→53C→54R paralleling the earlier
41C→42C→43R; §3 versions ADR-046 v1.22; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress + Current Phase
Steps rows added for D-1111 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5). Trajectory
tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-54 COMPLETE (the CONVERGENCE pass). **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1
MED) — F-P54-001, FIXED.** Genuine spec-vs-code step-number mis-citation, four loci, corrected by
architect. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 2/3 → 0/3** — the second reset at a convergence pass
this session. ADR-046 v1.21→**v1.22**; input-hash confirmed SETTLED (unchanged, `cb428ff`);
ARCH-INDEX v3.91→**v3.92**. Behavioral core re-confirmed CLEAN for the 28th consecutive pass.
CODIFIED the sixteenth convergence-technique discipline (STEP-NUMBER CITATION) plus 1 META lesson.
Fresh pass-55 is the documented NEXT action against the newly-frozen set (ADR-046 v1.22 +
BC-4.17.001 v1.24 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.37), starting a new streak toward literal

## D-1112

**D-1112-ADR046-PASS55-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1111 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1112 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 55 dispatched against the newly-frozen
pass-54-corrected set (ADR-046 v1.22 + BC-4.17.001 v1.24 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.37).
**VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any severity.** This is the first independent re-derivation of
the sixteenth convergence-technique discipline (STEP-NUMBER CITATION, codified at D-1111) since its
codification — the adversary independently re-derived every "Step N"/"Steps N-M" citation of
`verify-state-timestamp-refresh`'s own module-doc enumeration across ADR-046's body (§Context item
2, §Rationale, §Decision 3, §Decision 5) and confirmed all four loci now correctly read "Step 8"
(lock-expiry arm) and "Steps 4–7" (timestamp arm), cross-checked directly against
`crates/hook-plugins/verify-state-timestamp-refresh/src/lib.rs`'s own module-doc enumeration — the
F-P54-001 fix landed faithfully at every locus, no partial fix, no new mislabeling, no sibling
recurrence anywhere in the frozen set (within-artifact grep-complete sweep plus cross-BC check, both
clean). All fifteen other previously-codified convergence-technique disciplines also re-verified
holding with zero regression, including a fourth consecutive independent re-derivation of the ninth
discipline's D-1108 illustrative-enumeration extension. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 →
1/3** — the first clean pass against the pass-54-corrected set. Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-55.md`.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.22 / BC-4.17.001 v1.24 / BC-5.40.001 v1.20 / BC-7.07.001 v1.37. No
version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content is:
persist the pass-55 record and advance the streak counter, and record that all sixteen now-codified
convergence-technique disciplines — including the newly-codified sixteenth — continue holding under
a fresh independent re-derivation.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-55 re-applied all sixteen codified
convergence-technique disciplines proactively from the start, including the sixteenth discipline's
FIRST independent re-derivation since its D-1111 codification — the STEP-NUMBER CITATION discipline
holds: the F-P54-001 fix was applied completely and correctly at all four loci, with no sibling
recurrence anywhere in the frozen set. Zero BLOCKING findings. **CODIFIED this burst** (see
lessons.md): the sixteenth discipline's first post-codification confirmation, recorded as
`[convergence-progress]` per the established pattern (D-1093, D-1095, D-1098, D-1109, D-1110).

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.15, STORY-INDEX
v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79, ARCH-INDEX v3.92 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `cb428ff`, BC-4.17.001 `0edc756`, BC-5.40.001 `a21ce60`, BC-7.07.001
`673078a`) remain valid and unchanged, confirmed via literal `grep` re-read (burst-log.md Block 5).
Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-54" as the current/NEXT pass, to
streak value `0/3` (pre-advance), or to ADR-046 `v1.21` as the live version — matches confined to
PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1057..D-1111 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous
pass numbers/streak/version values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap
found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, first clean pass against the pass-54-corrected
set); Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED (ADR-046 v1.22, BC-4.17.001 v1.24, BC-5.40.001 v1.20,
BC-7.07.001 v1.37); Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3, pass-55 CLEAN, fresh
pass-56 NEXT); O-P42-001 and O-P53-DESC-NOOP stay tracked, UNCHANGED; Session Resume Checkpoint
refreshed (§2 streak 1/3, fresh pass-56 NEXT against the unchanged frozen set, history appends 55C;
§3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated — ON CONVERGENCE S-17.05 TDD unblocks); Phase
Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1112 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only
the last 5). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-55 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero findings at any
severity.** This is the first clean pass against the pass-54-corrected set, and the first
independent confirmation the newly-codified sixteenth discipline (STEP-NUMBER CITATION) holds. BC-

## D-1113

**D-1113-ADR046-PASS56-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1112 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1113 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 56 dispatched against the pass-54-corrected
set (ADR-046 v1.22 + BC-4.17.001 v1.24 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.37; streak entered this
pass at 1/3). **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED) — F-P56-001, FIXED (whole class).** ADR-046 and both
companion BCs (BC-4.17.001, BC-7.07.001) mischaracterized an empty-string, absent, or explicit-`null`
`holder` sub-field as equivalent to the pre-existing 0th case (`factory_lock:` fully absent/null —
"no lock held," silent `NoOp`), describing it as "inherited from `renew_lock`'s existing
presence-precheck." **CODE-VERIFIED FALSE** by direct inspection (architect):
`crates/factory-lock-parse/src/lib.rs`'s `parse_factory_lock` returns `Ok(None)` ONLY for a
fully-absent-or-fully-null block with NO sub-fields at all; an empty-string holder, or an absent
holder while other sub-fields are present, returns `Err(MalformedLockBlock(..))` — mapped by
`crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs`'s `renew_lock_with_now` to `Err(LockError::Malformed)`, case 1, NOT
`NoOp`. `has_factory_lock_key`'s presence pre-check tests only the literal `factory_lock:` key line,
never `holder`'s value, so the "inherited from `renew_lock`'s presence-precheck" grounding was FALSE.
An explicit `holder: null` YAML sub-field is a THIRD degenerate sub-case — `extract_yaml_string_value`
has no special-case for the bare `null` token, so it parses as the literal 4-char string `"null"`,
never absence — this sub-case was missed by the round-1 sweep and required a round-2 straggler fix.

Fixed by the correct specialists, whole class, across all three loci:
- **ADR-046 v1.22→v1.23 (architect):** §Decision 1(b)'s "Holder-present check" bullet + canonical
  five-case table's 0th-case parenthetical narrowed to `Ok(None)`-only; false grounding struck.
- **BC-4.17.001 v1.24→v1.25 (product-owner):** PC2 0th-case/case-1 bullets, EC-011, the
  `holder: ""` Canonical Test Vector, PC3b's non-goal event-suppression list.
- **BC-7.07.001 v1.37→v1.38→v1.39 (product-owner, 2 rounds):** round 1 (v1.38) — PC3, Invariant 3
  execution-order branch, new Invariant 3b; round 2 (v1.39) — EC-009's condition cell corrected
  (the missed `holder: null` straggler) + new EC-011 added (append-only) documenting the
  `holder: null` quirk's dispatch (case 1 if `locked_at`/`expires_at` absent; a genuinely-held lock
  with literal-string holder `"null"` if present+valid).
- **BC-5.40.001 v1.20, UNCHANGED:** cluster-checked CLEAN — its "malformed→unlocked" language
  describes `verify-factory-lock`'s own distinct call site, not an instance of this class.

No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered anywhere (append-only numbering preserved — POLICY 1); EC-011 is a new
ID, not a reuse. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-56.md`.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** — the SEVENTH streak reset this session, but
qualitatively the most substantive finding of the entire 56-pass convergence effort: the first
genuine spec-vs-code BEHAVIORAL divergence since the behavioral core stabilized at pass-27 (breaking
a 29-consecutive-pass clean streak on that specific dimension), as opposed to every prior post-pass-27
finding, which was confined to the provenance/citation/traceability/metadata perimeter. This is the
concrete payoff of the literal-3-CLEAN grind under BC-5.39.001 — a real edge-case defect that 55
prior passes walked past because no prior adversary had independently re-derived the parser's actual
`Ok`/`Err` partition for degenerate `holder` values from its own match arms, instead accepting the
spec's own "0th case, no lock held" framing at face value. Had this shipped uncorrected, S-17.05's
TDD implementation would have been built against a spec that contradicted the code it wraps.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** ARCH-INDEX **v3.92→v3.93** (ADR-046 row
bumped v1.22→v1.23; version-stable read-through convention preserved). BC-INDEX **v5.15→v5.16**
(BC-4.17.001 row v1.24→v1.25; BC-7.07.001 row v1.37→v1.39). STORY-INDEX v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79 both
UNCHANGED.

**Input-hash recompute (cyclic-hash TD [D-1082] — settled + cross-referenced, NOT reopened):**
`compute-input-hash --update` run for ADR-046, BC-4.17.001, BC-7.07.001 in edit order: ADR-046
`cb428ff`→`3335ad4` (1-hop residual accepted), BC-4.17.001 `0edc756`→`b7f7213` (1-hop residual
accepted), BC-7.07.001 `673078a`→`e73bc01` (**SETTLED**, confirmed via `--check` exit 0, last-edited
artifact this burst).

**EC-011 consistency check (task item 3):** `grep -n "EC-011"` against BC-7.07.001's body confirms
exactly ONE definition locus — no collision with any pre-existing EC-011 ID. This BC has no
`## Token Budget` section and no explicit "EC count" field to reconcile against the EC-011 addition —
nothing to flag for product-owner follow-up; consistent by omission.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-55" as the current/NEXT pass, to
streak value `1/3` (pre-reset), or to ADR-046 `v1.22`/BC-4.17.001 `v1.24`/BC-7.07.001 `v1.37` as the
live versions — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL rows (D-1057..D-1112 entries correctly
describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak/version values) and this same burst's own
new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**0/3** (RESETS, seventh reset this session, most substantive finding
of the effort); Current Artifact Versions ADR-046 v1.23, BC-4.17.001 v1.25, BC-7.07.001 v1.39
(BC-5.40.001 v1.20 UNCHANGED); ARCH-INDEX v3.93 + BC-INDEX v5.16 version cells; Blocking Issues
ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 0/3, pass-56 FINDINGS, fresh pass-57 NEXT); O-P42-001 and
O-P53-DESC-NOOP stay tracked, UNCHANGED; new Drift Item for the seventeenth discipline
(0TH-CASE/NO-OP CLAIM VERIFICATION); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 0/3, fresh
pass-57 NEXT, history appends 56R; §3 versions updated; §7 resume command updated — ON CONVERGENCE
S-17.05 TDD unblocks); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1113 (Current Phase
Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this
burst).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-56 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED) — F-P56-001, FIXED
(whole class).** BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** — the seventh reset this session,
but the most substantive: a genuine spec-vs-code behavioral divergence in the empty/absent/null-holder
0th-case characterization, found+fixed across ADR-046 + 2 companion BCs (incl. an EC-009 straggler
and new EC-011). ADR-046 v1.23; BC-4.17.001 v1.25; BC-7.07.001 v1.39. ARCH-INDEX v3.93; BC-INDEX
v5.16. Fresh pass-57 is the documented NEXT action against the newly-frozen set; needs 3 consecutive

## D-1114

**D-1114-ADR046-PASS57-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1113 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1114 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 57 dispatched against the newly-frozen
pass-56-corrected set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.25 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39).
**VERDICT: CLEAN — zero blocking findings at any severity.** The pass-56 F-P56-001 fix (whole-class
empty/absent/explicit-`null` `holder` 0th-case/case-1 boundary correction) was independently
re-verified correct across all four frozen-set artifacts against `parse_factory_lock`'s and
`renew_lock_with_now`'s actual source; every code claim, five-case-table boundary, cross-anchor,
parity leg, and bracket balance was re-derived and confirmed. All seventeen previously-codified
convergence-technique disciplines re-verified holding with zero regression, including the FIRST
independent re-derivation of the seventeenth discipline (0TH-CASE/NO-OP CLAIM VERIFICATION, D-1113)
since its own codifying fix. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3** — the first clean
pass against the pass-56-corrected set. Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-57.md`.

**One non-blocking documentation-symmetry item considered and adjudicated a NON-DEFECT, tracked as
O-P57-001:** BC-4.17.001's EC-011 covers `holder: ""` (empty string) but has no parallel `holder:
null` edge case, whereas BC-7.07.001 v1.39 added a `holder: null` EC-011 at the F-P56-001 round-2
straggler fix. The pass-57 adversary explicitly ruled this is NOT a defect: BC-4.17.001 makes no
false claim about `holder: null` — a literal-`"null"`-holder block flows correctly through its
general 0th-case/case-1..5 analysis; the asymmetry is that BC-4.17.001 simply does not illustrate
that sub-case as its own EC row, not that it asserts anything incorrect about it. This is a
cross-cluster illustrative-documentation asymmetry, and whether BC-4.17.001 should mirror the
illustrative EC is an authorial-intent/documentation-style question, not an adversary-adjudicable
content defect. **Disposition: ACCEPTED as a tracked non-blocking documentation-symmetry item, NOT
fixed this pass** — per the `[convergence-governance]` fix-vs-accept discipline (D-1101, extended at
D-1110 to streak-state-dependent weighing), fixing an optional illustrative-documentation item at
streak 1/3 would cost the live streak for no correctness gain. Anchor: OPTIONAL mirror of a `holder:
null` EC into BC-4.17.001 at a future non-gating touch (e.g. S-17.05 TDD or a maintenance sweep).
This is distinguished from O-P51-001 (a correctable inaccuracy that WAS fixed) precisely because
O-P57-001 asserts nothing false — there is no incorrect claim to correct, only an optional
elaboration to consider.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.23 / BC-4.17.001 v1.25 / BC-5.40.001 v1.20 / BC-7.07.001 v1.39. No version
bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change. This burst's sole content is: persist
the pass-57 record, advance the streak counter, and record the O-P57-001 adjudication as a tracked
accepted item.

**Novelty assessment (recorded, see lessons.md):** pass-57 re-applied all seventeen codified
convergence-technique disciplines proactively from the start and additionally applied a cross-BC
illustrative-EC-coverage-symmetry check (a genuinely new observation lens for this gate, made
possible only after the F-P56-001 round-2 fix introduced the BC-4.17.001/BC-7.07.001 EC-011
asymmetry). Zero BLOCKING findings; 1 LOW documentation-symmetry item considered and adjudicated a
NON-DEFECT (not counted as a finding, tracked as accepted). **CODIFIED this burst** (see
lessons.md): a fresh-context adversary explicitly adjudicating an item a NON-DEFECT (correct-as-is,
authorial-intent-optional) is accepted-and-tracked, not fixed — distinct from a correctable
inaccuracy (O-P51-001 was fixed).

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.16, STORY-INDEX
v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79, ARCH-INDEX v3.93 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `3335ad4`, BC-4.17.001 `b7f7213`, BC-5.40.001 `a21ce60`, BC-7.07.001
`e73bc01`) remain valid and unchanged, confirmed via literal `grep` re-read (burst-log.md Block 5).
Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened, NOT chased further this burst.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-56" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1057..D-1113 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, first clean pass against the pass-56-corrected
set); Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3,
pass-57 CLEAN, fresh pass-58 NEXT against the SAME unchanged frozen set); Drift Items gains
O-P57-001 (accepted non-blocking documentation-symmetry item) alongside O-P42-001 and
O-P53-DESC-NOOP (all UNCHANGED-status, tracked); Session Resume Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 1/3,
fresh pass-58 NEXT against the unchanged frozen set, history appends 57C; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7
resume command updated — ON CONVERGENCE S-17.05 TDD unblocks); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps
rows added for D-1114 (Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5). Trajectory tail
unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-57 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero blocking findings.**
This is the first clean pass against the pass-56-corrected set. One adversary-adjudicated
non-blocking documentation-symmetry item (O-P57-001) considered and ACCEPTED as tracked, not fixed.
BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → **1/3**. No spec artifact edited; no version bump; no
input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-58 is the documented NEXT action against the
SAME unchanged frozen set; needs 2 more consecutive clean passes (58, 59) for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1115

**D-1115-ADR046-PASS58-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1114 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1115 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 58 dispatched against the SAME unchanged
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.25 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39; streak entered
at 1/3). **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED) + 2 OBS.** Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-58.md`.

**F-P58-001 (MED, POLICY 4 internal-consistency), FIXED:** BC-4.17.001's §Description ADR-046-coverage
sentence and §Traceability ADR Reference row enumerated this BC's own ADR-046 coverage as "Decisions
1, 2, and 4" only — omitting **Decision 5** — despite this same BC's own Precondition 4, Invariant 7,
Invariant 8, EC-015, and VP-TBD-7/8/9 all carrying explicit "MIGRATED … per ADR-046 §Decision 5"
annotations, and despite BC-4.17.001 being the designated migration TARGET of Decision 5 per
ADR-046's File-Change Plan + Companion Amendment 1 item (vi) (originally sourced at F-P4-002, v1.4).
Fixed by product-owner (BC-4.17.001 v1.25→**v1.26**): §Description now states Decision 5 coverage
alongside 1/2/4; §Traceability ADR Reference row adds a `§Decision 5` line with a short summary
(migrated read-cap/`extract_frontmatter`/soft-warn/`OutputTooLarge` guard-read reconciliation from
BC-5.40.001's retired `verify-state-timestamp-refresh`). No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered (append-only
numbering preserved — POLICY 1). **Same defect CLASS as O-P48-001** (under-inclusive ADR-Decision
coverage enumeration), re-surfacing at a different BC/Decision pairing — not a new discipline, an
instance of an existing one.

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak RESETS 1/3 → 0/3** — the 8th reset this session.

**Two non-blocking observations considered and adjudicated NON-DEFECT, tracked:**

- **O-P58-001 (LOW):** the F-P27-001 (§Story Anchor) vs F-P25-002 (§Traceability) provenance-ID split
  used by BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001, versus BC-4.17.001 citing only F-P25-002 at both loci, was
  independently re-derived by the adversary and **CONFIRMED CORRECT PROVENANCE**: F-P25-002 (pass-25)
  is the origin fix resolving the `[pending]` S-17.05 placeholder at §Traceability across all three
  BCs; F-P27-001 (pass-27) was a §Story-Anchor-specific sibling-sweep fix applied only to
  BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 because BC-4.17.001's own pass-25 fix had already touched BOTH loci in the
  same burst, leaving no separate gap for a pass-27 fix to close. No edit. Tracked so future passes do
  not re-raise this as a fresh finding.
- **O-P58-002 (LOW):** BC-4.17.001's `status: draft` and `lifecycle_status: draft` frontmatter fields
  cross-checked against each other and POL-14 auto-promotion criteria — both correctly `draft` (S-17.05
  has not yet merged an implementing PR). NON-DEFECT, noted only, no edit.

**Process note:** the product-owner turn implementing the F-P58-001 fix dropped mid-edit on an API
loss and was resumed to completion by a fresh product-owner dispatch; the resumed turn re-verified the
partial edit state on disk before continuing. Final state (BC-4.17.001 v1.26, §Description +
§Traceability both corrected, Changelog row + `modified:` entry both present) confirmed complete
before this record was persisted. Non-blocking.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** BC-INDEX v5.16→**v5.17** (BC-4.17.001 row
version-cell + Changelog cross-ref, POLICY 8 table-cell-aware). STORY-INDEX v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79,
ARCH-INDEX v3.93 all UNCHANGED (ADR-046/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 not edited this pass).

**Input-hash recompute:** BC-4.17.001 `b7f7213`→`6b0b35c` via `compute-input-hash` (cyclic-hash TD
`[D-1082]`, settled + cross-referenced, NOT reopened). ADR-046 `3335ad4`, BC-5.40.001 `a21ce60`,
BC-7.07.001 `e73bc01` remain unchanged (not edited this pass).

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to BC-4.17.001 `v1.25`/`b7f7213` as current, or
to a streak value other than the correct post-reset `0/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1057..D-1114 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous versions/streak values)
and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**0/3** (RESETS, 8th reset this session, history appends 58R); fresh
**pass-59** documented NEXT against the pass-58-corrected frozen set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001

unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this burst).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-58 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED) + 2 OBS.** F-P58-001
(under-inclusive ADR-Decision-5 coverage enumeration in BC-4.17.001) FIXED by product-owner

## D-1116

**D-1116-ADR046-PASS59-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-REMEDIATION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1115 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1116 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 59 dispatched against the SAME unchanged
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 + BC-5.40.001 v1.20 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39; streak entered
at 0/3, already at floor from pass-58). **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED).** Full record:
`adv-adr-046-pass-59.md`.

**F-P59-001 (MED, POLICY 4 internal-consistency), FIXED:** BC-5.40.001's §Traceability ADR Reference
row and §Description named ADR-046 coverage only for §Decision 1(b) (PC4 actor reassignment) —
omitting **Decision 5** — despite this same BC's own Precondition 6, Invariant 7, Invariant 8,
EC-010, and §Verification Properties/§VP Anchors T-001..T-007 all carrying explicit
"MIGRATED/RETAINED-AS-HISTORICAL … per ADR-046 §Decision 5" annotations. This is the **mirror-image
gap of BC-4.17.001's own F-P58-001** (fixed at pass-58, v1.26, on the migration TARGET side) — this
is the same gap on the migration SOURCE side, never itself swept when the pass-58 fix landed.
Fixed by product-owner (BC-5.40.001 v1.20→**v1.21**): §Description gains a sentence stating ADR-046
§Decision 5 reconciles the guard-read contract originally specified here (Precondition
6/Invariants 7-8/EC-010), migrated out to BC-4.17.001, retained here only as a historical/dormant
record per §Decision 5's crate-retention clause; §Traceability ADR Reference row now cites
`ADR-046 §Decision 1(b)/§Decision 5` with a §Decision 5 summary. No PC/Invariant/EC renumbered
(append-only numbering preserved — POLICY 1). **Same defect CLASS as O-P48-001/F-P58-001**
(under-inclusive ADR-Decision coverage enumeration), re-surfacing at a different BC/Decision
pairing — not a new discipline, an instance of an existing one.

**Mandatory cluster-wide ADR-Decision-coverage audit (in-scope, this pass, per the D-1115-codified
discipline):** every `ADR-046 §Decision N`/`ADR-025 §Decision N` token in the live bodies of
BC-4.17.001 and BC-7.07.001 was enumerated and cross-checked against each BC's own §Traceability
ADR Reference row. BC-4.17.001's v1.26 §Decision 5 addition **CONFIRMED COMPLETE** (body cites only
§Decision 1/1(b)/2/4/5, all present in its row — no gap). BC-7.07.001's body cites only
`ADR-046 §Decision 1(b)/3/4`, matching its own ADR Reference row exactly — **CONFIRMED CLEAN**
(BC-7.07.001 is not a participant in the §Decision 5 migration). BC-7.07.001's `ADR-025 §Decision 11`
body citations and BC-4.17.001's/BC-5.40.001's `ADR-025 §Decision 14` cap-sourcing citations are
passing supporting-citation footnotes, symmetrically already omitted from all three BCs' ADR
Reference rows — confirmed not a fresh drift, no action required. **Result: BC-5.40.001 was the LAST
remaining gap in the cluster; all three companion BCs now confirmed complete.**

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak STAYS 0/3** — already at floor entering this pass from pass-58's reset;
this fix burst does not add a further reset (the streak counter has no lower bound below 0/3, and a
finding against an already-reset gate does not decrement further — it simply keeps the gate open).

**No non-blocking observations this pass.** The two carried-forward observations from pass-58
(O-P58-001, O-P58-002) were re-examined and remain ACCEPTED-tracked, untouched.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** BC-INDEX v5.17→**v5.18** (BC-5.40.001 row
version-cell + Changelog cross-ref, POLICY 8 table-cell-aware). STORY-INDEX v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79,
ARCH-INDEX v3.93 all UNCHANGED (ADR-046/BC-4.17.001/BC-7.07.001 not edited this pass).

**Input-hash recompute:** BC-5.40.001 `a21ce60`→`6a9cc08` via `compute-input-hash` (cyclic-hash TD
`[D-1082]`, settled + cross-referenced, NOT reopened). ADR-046 `3335ad4`, BC-4.17.001 `6b0b35c`,
BC-7.07.001 `e73bc01` remain unchanged (not edited this pass).

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to BC-5.40.001 `v1.20`/`a21ce60` as current, or
to a streak value inconsistent with the correct `0/3` floor — matches confined to PRESERVED
HISTORICAL rows (D-1057..D-1115 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous
versions/streak values) and this same burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**[CODIFICATION][process-gap] SWEEP-BOTH-MIGRATION-PARTIES-AT-FIX-TIME (reinforces D-1104):** when a
fix closes a migration-coverage/cross-reference finding on one artifact (here: BC-4.17.001, the
migration TARGET, at pass-58/F-P58-001), the fix-burst MUST also sweep the artifact's migration
COUNTERPART (here: BC-5.40.001, the migration SOURCE) AND run the cluster-wide audit AT FIX TIME —
not defer the sibling check to the next pass. The pass-58 fix-burst touched only BC-4.17.001; the
pass-58 disposition prose itself anchored the sibling sweep as "apply proactively … at the next
pass" rather than performing it in the same burst, and pass-59 (this burst) is exactly that deferred
sweep landing one pass later than necessary, costing a full adversary cycle. This is the SAME
single-artifact-scoped-fix root cause as the AC-attribution class drained at D-1104 (eleventh
discipline): a fix confined to the artifact the finding was raised against, without also sweeping
the artifact's structural counterpart, reliably reproduces the same finding CLASS at the counterpart
on the very next pass. **Standing rule (extends D-1104 to the ADR-Decision-coverage-enumeration
discipline and to all future class-draining audits):** any fix to an inputs/AC-ref/ADR-Decision-
coverage/cross-anchor/byte-range finding MUST, in the SAME burst, sweep ALL cluster artifacts party
to that finding's class — for a migration-class finding specifically, BOTH the migration SOURCE and
the migration TARGET, plus the cluster-wide audit — not just the artifact literally named in the
finding text.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak stays **0/3** (no further reset — already at floor); fresh **pass-60**
documented NEXT against the pass-59-corrected frozen set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 +
BC-5.40.001 **v1.21** + BC-7.07.001 v1.39); Current Artifact Versions BC-5.40.001 v1.21
(ADR-046/BC-4.17.001/BC-7.07.001 unchanged); BC-INDEX version cell v5.18; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate
row updated (streak 0/3, pass-59 FINDINGS(1) fixed, fresh pass-60 NEXT); Drift Items gains
[D-1116][codified][process-gap] SWEEP-BOTH-MIGRATION-PARTIES-AT-FIX-TIME discipline entry; O-P42-001,

v1.21; §7 resume command updated); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1116
(Current Phase Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not
touched this burst).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-59 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: FINDINGS (1 MED).** F-P59-001
(under-inclusive ADR-Decision-5 coverage enumeration in BC-5.40.001 — the mirror-image sibling of
pass-58's F-P58-001) FIXED by product-owner (v1.20→v1.21), plus a mandatory cluster-wide audit
confirming BC-4.17.001 and BC-7.07.001 both complete/clean. BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak **STAYS 0/3**.
BC-INDEX v5.17→v5.18. Input-hash recomputed for BC-5.40.001 (`a21ce60`→`6a9cc08`). New codification:
sweep-both-migration-parties-at-fix-time (reinforces D-1104). Fresh pass-60 is the documented NEXT

## D-1117

**D-1117-ADR046-PASS60-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1116 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1117 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 60 dispatched against the pass-59-corrected
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 + BC-5.40.001 v1.21 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39; streak
entered at 0/3, at floor from pass-58/59 FINDINGS). **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero blocking findings at
any severity.** Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-60.md`.

This pass was a **substantive** clean: the adversary read all four frozen-set artifacts in full and
independently verified every behavioral claim against actual code at
`crates/factory-lock-parse/src/lib.rs` (`parse_factory_lock`, `extract_frontmatter`,
`extract_yaml_string_value`), `crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs` (`renew_lock_with_now`,
`has_factory_lock_key`), `crates/hook-plugins/verify-factory-lock/src/lib.rs` (`is_expired`,
`parse_iso8601`), `crates/hook-plugins/precompact-flush/src/lib.rs` (Step-4 `renew_lock`), and
`plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/factory-lock-write.sh` (TTL literal `2700`). **All eight code claims
MATCH.**

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3** — the first clean pass against the
pass-59-corrected frozen set (itself the first clean pass since the pass-58 reset at the eighth
reset of this session).

**Two non-blocking observations considered and adjudicated NON-DEFECT, tracked:**

- **O-P60-001 (LOW, robustness note):** `extract_frontmatter` (BC-4.17.001 PC4/Invariant 7)
  detects only the closing `\n---\n` delimiter and assumes byte 0 is the opening delimiter. A
  pathological input lacking an opening `---\n` but containing a stray `\n---\n` could be
  mis-identified as having a "located fence." Adjudicated NON-DEFECT: PC2's `parse_factory_lock`
  independently enforces the opening-delimiter requirement upstream, making the pathological input
  unreachable for real STATE.md content. ACCEPTED-tracked; anchored to the S-17.05 implementer to
  either add an explicit opening-fence validation inside `extract_frontmatter` or document the
  heuristic in the function's doc-comment. Non-blocking.
- **O-P60-002 (NON-DEFECT, adjudicated):** BC-5.40.001 §Traceability cites `trim_git_email`
  (ADR-046 Decision 2/F-004) in its cross-reference column. One could read this as an implicit
  §Decision 2 participation not enumerated in the ADR-Decision coverage row. Adjudicated NON-DEFECT:
  `trim_git_email` appears as a functional-dependency cross-reference, not a migration-participant
  relationship; BC-5.40.001 was never a TARGET or SOURCE of the §Decision 2 identity-mechanism
  changes. The §Traceability enumeration is complete. No action.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.23 / BC-4.17.001 v1.26 / BC-5.40.001 v1.21 / BC-7.07.001 v1.39. No
version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change.

**Novelty assessment:** LOW. All seventeen codified convergence-technique disciplines re-verified
holding, zero regression. O-P60-001 applies a new robustness lens (opening-fence assumption in
`extract_frontmatter`), analogous to O-P57-001's cross-BC EC-coverage-symmetry lens; not a new
discipline. See adv-adr-046-pass-60.md §Novelty Assessment for the full seventeen-discipline list.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.18, STORY-INDEX
v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79, ARCH-INDEX v3.93 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `3335ad4`, BC-4.17.001 `6b0b35c`, BC-5.40.001 `6a9cc08`, BC-7.07.001
`e73bc01`) remain valid and unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-59" as the current/NEXT pass or to a
streak value other than the correct post-advance `1/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED HISTORICAL
rows (D-1057..D-1116 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass numbers/streak
values) and this burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 0/3→**1/3** (ADVANCES, first clean pass against the pass-59-corrected
set); pipeline PAUSED→ACTIVE; version 9.06→9.07; Current Artifact Versions UNCHANGED; Blocking
Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 1/3, pass-60 CLEAN, fresh pass-61 NEXT against the SAME
unchanged frozen set); Blocking Issues rc.24 marketplace PR #19 row CLOSED (PR merged 2026-08-27);
Drift Items gains O-P60-001 (robustness note, accepted non-blocking) alongside O-P42-001,
O-P53-DESC-NOOP, O-P57-001, O-P58-001/O-P58-002 (all UNCHANGED-status, tracked); Session Resume
Checkpoint refreshed (§2 streak 1/3, fresh pass-61 NEXT against the unchanged frozen set, history
appends 60C; §3 versions UNCHANGED; §7 resume command updated; §8 accepted-tracked items adds
O-P60-001/O-P60-002); Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1117 (Current Phase
Steps table trimmed to keep only the last 5). Trajectory tail unchanged (Wave-7 not touched this
burst — →1→1→0→1, LENGTH=4 carries forward).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-60 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero blocking findings.**
This is the first clean pass against the pass-59-corrected set. Two adversary-adjudicated
non-blocking observations (O-P60-001/O-P60-002) both NON-DEFECT, ACCEPTED-tracked, not fixed.
**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3.** No spec artifact edited; no version bump; no
input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX change. Fresh pass-61 is the documented NEXT action against the
SAME unchanged frozen set; needs 2 more consecutive clean passes (61, 62) for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1118

**D-1118-ADR046-PASS61-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1117 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1118 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

ADR-046 fresh-context adversary spec-convergence pass 61 dispatched against the unchanged
frozen set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 + BC-5.40.001 v1.21 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39; streak
entered at 1/3, from pass-60 CLEAN D-1117). **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero blocking findings at any
severity.** Full record: `adv-adr-046-pass-61.md`.

This pass was a **substantive** clean: the adversary read all four frozen-set artifacts in full
and independently verified every behavioral claim against actual code at
`crates/factory-lock-parse/src/lib.rs` (`parse_factory_lock` lines 207-227,
`extract_yaml_string_value` no null-special-casing), `crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs`
(`renew_lock_with_now` bare Duration::seconds(2700)/byte-compare only, `has_factory_lock_key`
key-line-only), `crates/hook-plugins/verify-factory-lock/src/lib.rs` (`is_expired`
now>=expires_at, `trim_git_email`), `crates/hook-plugins/precompact-flush/src/lib.rs` (Step-4
identity-blind `renew_lock`), and `plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/factory-lock-write.sh` (TTL literal
`TTL_SECONDS=2700`). Confirmed absent from code (design-only, S-17.05 unimplemented):
`renew_lock_if_holder`, `classify_identity_resolution`, `SkipReason`, `IdentityResolution`.
**All nine code claims MATCH.** Cross-cutting checks also PASSED: POLICY 7 (H1↔BC-INDEX title
byte-identical ×3), POLICY 19 (stable ADR anchors, no load-bearing vX.Y), POLICY 4
(Decision-participation enumeration complete: BC-4.17.001 §Dec 1/2/4/5; BC-5.40.001 §Dec
1(b)/5; BC-7.07.001 §Dec 1(b)/3/4), capability anchoring vs capabilities.md CAP-031/032,
POLICY 14/17 (5-leg parity ×3), POLICY 1 (no renumbering; EC-011 new ID), POLICY 18
(inputs[] complete), five-case return-value table identity (ADR ≡ BC-7.07.001 ≡ BC-4.17.001 PC2).

**BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 1/3 → 2/3** — the second consecutive clean pass against
the pass-59-corrected frozen set. 1 more consecutive clean pass (pass-62) reaches literal 3-CLEAN,
unblocking S-17.05 TDD implementation.

**Three non-blocking observations considered:**

- **O-P61-001 (LOW severity, HIGH confidence — CORRECTABLE CODE DEFECT, outside frozen spec set):**
  `crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs` doc-comments still describe the pre-F-P56-001 semantics —
  `renew_lock` algorithm doc (~line 113 "Ok(None) → NoOp when holder null/absent"), inline comment
  at the Ok(None) arm (~lines 158-160 "Key was present but lock is null/absent holder → NoOp"),
  and `parse_lock` doc (~line 318 "Ok(None) — key absent or holder is null/absent/empty"). Ground
  truth (`factory-lock-parse/src/lib.rs` lines 219-227): empty-string holder OR absent holder w/
  siblings present → `Err(MalformedLockBlock)`, NEVER `Ok(None)`. The FROZEN SPECS are all correct
  (POLICY 15 satisfied); this is the unswept SIBLING code-doc locus of the F-P56-001 defect class.
  **TRACKED DEFECT-TO-FIX — NOT accept-and-forget.** Candidate owner: implementer. Candidate
  anchor: S-17.05 (touches these functions). Fix pending human sequencing confirmation.

- **O-P61-002 (adjudicated NON-DEFECT):** BC-4.17.001 has no `holder: null` EC analogous to
  BC-7.07.001 EC-011 — correct: BC-7.07.001 EC-011 corrected a prior wrong EC-009 claim; BC-4.17.001
  never carried that wrong claim; `holder: "null"` is subsumed by case-3. No missing coverage.
  ACCEPTED-tracked (re-observation of O-P57-001 at a more specific locus; same adjudication).

- **O-P61-003 (adjudicated NON-DEFECT):** BC-5.40.001 PC4 abstracts empty-holder into "(a) fails
  → no renewal" — correct: BC-5.40.001 delegates granular five-case dispatch to the shared truth
  table + BC-4.17.001/BC-7.07.001; makes no contradictory Ok(None)/0th claim. ACCEPTED-tracked.

**This is a CLEAN pass, NOT a fix burst.** No spec artifact was edited this burst — the frozen set
is UNCHANGED at ADR-046 v1.23 / BC-4.17.001 v1.26 / BC-5.40.001 v1.21 / BC-7.07.001 v1.39. No
version bump, no input-hash recompute, no 4-INDEX version-cell change.

**Novelty assessment:** LOW. All seventeen codified convergence-technique disciplines re-verified
holding, zero regression. O-P61-001 applies the existing TD-VSDD-060 sibling-sweep discipline to
a new target locus (implementation crate doc-comments); not a new discipline. See
adv-adr-046-pass-61.md §Novelty Assessment for the full seventeen-discipline list.

**Index reconciliation (state-manager, this burst):** none required — BC-INDEX v5.18, STORY-INDEX
v4.392, VP-INDEX v2.79, ARCH-INDEX v3.93 all UNCHANGED (no artifact touched this pass, per the
CLEAN-pass discipline: do NOT bump versions or recompute input-hashes when nothing was edited).

**Input-hash recompute:** NOT PERFORMED — no artifact content changed this burst; the stored
input-hashes (ADR-046 `3335ad4`, BC-4.17.001 `6b0b35c`, BC-5.40.001 `6a9cc08`, BC-7.07.001
`e73bc01`) remain valid and unchanged. Cyclic-hash TD `[D-1082]` UNCHANGED, NOT re-opened.

**Defensive sweep (S-7.02):** grepped BC-INDEX.md, ARCH-INDEX.md, STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md,
VP-INDEX.md, decision-log.md for any stale reference to "pass-60" as the current/NEXT pass or
to a streak value other than the correct post-advance `2/3` — matches confined to PRESERVED
HISTORICAL rows (D-1057..D-1117 entries correctly describing their own contemporaneous pass
numbers/streak values) and this burst's own new content. No propagation gap found.

**STATE.md vNext:** streak 1/3→**2/3** (ADVANCES, second consecutive clean pass against the
pass-59-corrected set); pipeline remains ACTIVE; version 9.07→9.08; Current Artifact Versions
UNCHANGED; Blocking Issues ADR-046-gate row updated (streak 2/3, pass-61 CLEAN, fresh pass-62
NEXT against the SAME unchanged frozen set); Drift Items gains O-P61-001 (tracked defect-to-fix,
candidate anchor S-17.05); O-P61-002/O-P61-003 added to Session Resume Checkpoint accepted-tracked
list; Phase Progress + Current Phase Steps rows added for D-1118 (Current Phase Steps table
trimmed to keep only the last 5). Trajectory tail updated →1→1→0→1 → →1→0→1→0, LENGTH=4
(pass-61 CLEAN = 0 appended, oldest 1 dropped).

Summary: ADR-046 spec-convergence pass-61 COMPLETE. **VERDICT: CLEAN — zero blocking findings.**
Second consecutive clean pass against the pass-59-corrected frozen set. Three adversary-adjudicated
non-blocking observations: O-P61-001 TRACKED DEFECT-TO-FIX (code doc-comments, NOT deferred/accepted),
O-P61-002/O-P61-003 NON-DEFECT, ACCEPTED-tracked. **BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN streak ADVANCES 1/3 →
2/3.** No spec artifact edited; no version bump; no input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX change.
Fresh pass-62 is the documented NEXT action against the SAME unchanged frozen set; 1 more
consecutive clean pass for literal 3-CLEAN.

## D-1119

**D-1119-ADR046-PASS62-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-RESET**

**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Agents:** adversary (fresh-context; adv-adr-046-pass-62.md), state-manager (fix burst; ARCH-INDEX edit + bookkeeping)
**Decision:** ADR-046 BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN spec-convergence gate pass-62 FINDINGS (1 MED) — F-P62-001 FIXED (structural); BC-5.39.001 streak RESETS 2/3→0/3 (9th reset); fresh pass-63 NEXT against same frozen set.

**Verdict:** FINDINGS (1 MEDIUM — F-P62-001)

**Finding F-P62-001 (MEDIUM; POLICY 14/17 upstream-index version parity + POLICY 4 intra-cell inconsistency):** In `.factory/specs/architecture/ARCH-INDEX.md`, `## Architecture Decisions` table, ADR-046 row Decision-Summary cell headline, the text `**RATIFIED 2026-08-25; ADR-046 v1.18 as of this row.**` was stale by 5 revisions (live ADR-046 frontmatter `version: "1.23"`; cell tail recorded v1.22→v1.23 at pass-56). Self-contradicts the cell's own tail content. NEW LOCUS of O-P28-002 recurrence class — FALSIFIES O-P28-002's "version-stable by construction" claim (the O-P28-002 fix closed the instruction-row staleness vector but left the output-cell embedded-literal vector open). Owner: state-manager (ARCH-INDEX per POLICY 6).

**Fix applied (structural, TD-VSDD-059):** ARCH-INDEX.md ADR-046 row headline rewritten from `**RATIFIED 2026-08-25; ADR-046 v1.18 as of this row.**` to `**RATIFIED 2026-08-25; current version per ADR-046 frontmatter (tail records bump history).**` — eliminates the sweep-every-touch requirement permanently. NOT a paper-patch to v1.23 (which would restale on the next ADR touch). ARCH-INDEX v3.93→**v3.94** (POLICY 14/17 5-leg parity: version + changelog row + last_amended prefix + cell body fix + STATE.md identifier-conventions cite).

**Human adjudication (2026-08-27; literal-3-CLEAN standard):** Out-of-frozen-set finding still resets BC-5.39.001 streak per human ruling. Streak 2/3→0/3 (9th reset this session).

**Frozen spec artifacts:** ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 + BC-5.40.001 v1.21 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39 — ALL UNCHANGED.

**Observations recorded:**
- O-P62-001 [out-of-perimeter]: `crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs` doc-comments stale pre-F-P56-001 semantics. Same locus as O-P61-001. Status updated: **BOUND to S-17.05 (human-directed 2026-08-27)**. Owner: implementer.
- O-P62-002 [LOW, awareness only]: Finding-ID provenance divergence (BC-4.17.001/BC-7.07.001 label `classify_identity_resolution` mandate "F-003"; ADR-046 labels "F-006"). Substance identical; per-document labels; NOT a POLICY 4 mis-anchor. Recorded for awareness.
- O-P62-003 [process-observation]: O-P28-002 "version-stable by construction" claim falsified by F-P62-001. Durable close is the structural restatement above.

**4-INDEX after this burst:**
- ARCH-INDEX: v3.93→**v3.94** (F-P62-001 fix)
- BC-INDEX: v5.18 (UNCHANGED — no BC edited)
- VP-INDEX: v2.79 (UNCHANGED)
- STORY-INDEX: v4.392 (UNCHANGED)

Fixed: headline rewritten to `**RATIFIED 2026-08-25; current version per ADR-046 frontmatter (tail records bump history).**` — eliminates sweep-every-touch recurrence; O-P28-002 "version-stable by construction" claim falsified and durably closed. ARCH-INDEX v3.93→**v3.94**. Frozen spec set UNCHANGED. Human adjudication: out-of-frozen-set finding resets per literal-3-CLEAN standard (2026-08-27). **BC-5.39.001 streak RESETS 2/3→0/3 (9th reset)**. O-P62-001 BOUND to S-17.05 (human-directed).

## D-1121

**D-1121-ADR046-PASS63-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Agents:** adversary (fresh-context; adv-adr-046-pass-63.md), state-manager (CLEAN-pass bookkeeping)
**Decision:** ADR-046 BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN spec-convergence gate pass-63 CLEAN — zero blocking findings; BC-5.39.001 streak ADVANCES 0/3→1/3; frozen set UNCHANGED; no spec artifact edited.

**Verdict:** CLEAN — zero blocking findings at any severity.

**Substantive verification:** Adversary independently re-derived the model from code + specs and verified every behavioral claim against source. All seventeen spec-vs-code ground-truth checks MATCH:

- `parse_factory_lock` empty/absent-holder→Err(Malformed); `Ok(None)` only for absent/fully-null block
- `renew_lock_with_now` opaque-String `expires_at`/byte-compare/never date-parses
- `parse_iso8601` exists for the case-1 re-derived `is_expired` check
- `is_expired` now>=expires_at
- `trim_git_email` trim_end
- Three TTL literals 2700 incl u64
- Precompact-flush Step-4 identity-blind renew_lock
- `FactoryLock` vs `LockState` distinction
- `extract_yaml_string_value` holder:null→literal "null"
- `verify-state-timestamp-refresh` Steps 4-7/8 F-P54-001 fix
- Five-case table byte-consistent across ADR/BC-4.17.001 PC2/BC-7.07.001 Inv3b
- Decision-5 migration reconciled both ends
- POLICY 4/6 CAP-031/032 anchors correct
- POLICY 19 no live-body load-bearing ADR pins
- Sibling-sweep no unswept holder:null straggler
- F-P62-001 structural fix held (ARCH-INDEX ADR-046 row now version-stable by construction)

**F-P62-001 RETIRED under fresh lens:** ARCH-INDEX ADR-046 row headline now reads "current version per ADR-046 frontmatter (tail records bump history)" — recurrence mechanism eliminated; O-P28-002 falsification durably closed.

**Observations (non-blocking, non-defect):**
- O-P63-i: cyclic-hash input-hash 1-hop residual (D-1082) — tracked, not fresh; ACCEPTED-TRACKED; no new entry.
- O-P63-ii: BC-INDEX catalog megaline grep limitation — not a finding; D-1073 architectural debt; no new entry.

**Frozen spec artifacts:** ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 + BC-5.40.001 v1.21 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39 — ALL UNCHANGED.

**THIS IS A CLEAN PASS, NOT A FIX BURST** — no spec artifact edited; no version bump; no input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX version-cell change.

**BC-5.39.001 streak ADVANCES 0/3 → 1/3.** First clean pass of the post-pass-62-reset sequence. Two more consecutive clean passes (64, 65) needed for literal 3-CLEAN, which unblocks S-17.05 TDD.

**Novelty:** NONE (converged).

**4-INDEX after this burst:**
- ARCH-INDEX: v3.94 (UNCHANGED)
- BC-INDEX: v5.18 (UNCHANGED)
- VP-INDEX: v2.79 (UNCHANGED)

## D-1122

**D-1122-ADR046-PASS64-SPEC-CONVERGENCE-CLEAN**

**Date:** 2026-08-27
**Agents:** adversary (fresh-context; adv-adr-046-pass-64.md), state-manager (CLEAN-pass bookkeeping)
**Decision:** ADR-046 BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN spec-convergence gate pass-64 CLEAN — zero blocking findings; BC-5.39.001 streak ADVANCES 1/3→2/3; frozen set UNCHANGED; no spec artifact edited.

**Verdict:** CLEAN — zero blocking findings at any severity.

**Substantive verification:** Adversary independently re-derived the model from code + specs and verified every behavioral claim against source. All seventeen spec-vs-code ground-truth checks MATCH:

- `parse_factory_lock` empty/absent-holder→Err(Malformed); `Ok(None)` only for absent/fully-null block
- `renew_lock_with_now` opaque-String `expires_at`/byte-compare/never date-parses (case-1 RE-DERIVED accurate)
- `parse_iso8601` used for case-1 `is_expired` check
- `is_expired` now>=expires_at
- `trim_git_email` trim_end
- Three TTL literals 2700 incl u64; "MUST NOT be overridden" comment verified
- Precompact-flush Step-4 identity-blind renew_lock (LOCK_RENEWAL_TTL_SECS u64=2700)
- `FactoryLock` vs `LockState` distinction
- `extract_yaml_string_value` holder:null→literal "null" (EC-011 accurate)
- `verify-state-timestamp-refresh` Steps 4-7/8 module-doc (F-P54-001 fix)
- Five-case table byte-consistent across ADR/BC-4.17.001 PC2/BC-7.07.001 Inv3b
- Decision-5 migration reconciled both ends; MIGRATED/RETAINED-AS-HISTORICAL symmetric (TARGET BC-4.17.001 v1.26 / SOURCE BC-5.40.001 v1.21)
- POLICY 4/6/19 PASS; no load-bearing ADR version pins (POLICY 19)
- F-P62-001 structural fix re-confirmed holding: ARCH-INDEX ADR-046 row version-stable; O-P28-002 durably closed
- Sibling-sweep: no unswept holder:null straggler

**Observations (non-blocking, NON-DEFECT — both ALREADY TRACKED, no new action):**
- O-P64-001 [NON-DEFECT, documentation-symmetry]: BC-4.17.001 has no explicit `holder: null` illustrative EC while siblings BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 do. Adjudicated NON-DEFECT (BC-4.17.001's general five-case PC2 gate covers `holder: "null"` correctly; not spec-vs-code). SAME class as O-P57-001 (D-1114). Authorial-intent question for product-owner per S-7.01; remains ACCEPTED-tracked; no new entry beyond noting the recurrence.
- O-P64-002 [out-of-perimeter → implementer]: stale `factory-lock` crate doc-comments (crates/factory-lock/src/lib.rs, renew_lock_with_now algorithm doc / Ok(None)-arm inline comment / parse_lock doc). ALREADY CAPTURED in S-17.05 v1.1 Task T-8 (D-1120). Runtime behavior correct; only doc-comments stale. No new action.

**Frozen spec artifacts:** ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 + BC-5.40.001 v1.21 + BC-7.07.001 v1.39 — ALL UNCHANGED.

**THIS IS A CLEAN PASS, NOT A FIX BURST** — no spec artifact edited; no version bump; no input-hash recompute; no 4-INDEX version-cell change.

**BC-5.39.001 streak ADVANCES 1/3 → 2/3.** Second consecutive clean pass of the post-pass-62-reset sequence. One more consecutive clean pass (65) needed for literal 3-CLEAN, which unblocks S-17.05 TDD.

**Novelty:** LOW (converged; behavioral core clean for many passes since pass-27).

**Decision:** ADR-046 BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN spec-convergence gate pass-65 CLEAN — THIRD consecutive clean pass; LITERAL 3-CLEAN ACHIEVED (63/64/65); frozen set UNCHANGED; no spec artifact edited; convergence closure PENDING fresh-context consistency audit + human gate approval.

**Verdict:** CLEAN — zero blocking findings at any severity.

**Substantive verification:** Adversary independently corroborated 14 load-bearing spec-vs-code claims against source (frozen set confirmed ADR-046 v1.23/BC-4.17.001 v1.26/BC-5.40.001 v1.21/BC-7.07.001 v1.39):

## D-1124

**D-1124-ADR046-3CLEAN-CONVERGED-PERIMETER-AUDIT-WAVE-DECOMPOSITION-DECISION**

Allocated as the next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1123 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1124 is allocated cleanly above the true max.

**Summary:** Records three concurrent events: (1) ADR-046 BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN
CONVERGED-VALIDATED — the fresh-context consistency-validator perimeter audit independently
confirmed the frozen spec set (ADR-046 v1.23 + BC-4.17.001 v1.26 + BC-5.40.001 v1.21 +
BC-7.07.001 v1.39) is internally consistent and the 3-CLEAN (passes 63/64/65) is VALID; (2) the
perimeter audit found PERIMETER-GAPS in the implementing story S-17.05 (not the specs); (3) the
human directed wave-decomposition remediation (S-17.05 + S-17.06 + S-17.07) as the path forward.

### Part 1: ADR-046 Spec-Convergence Gate — CONVERGED-VALIDATED

The fresh-context consistency-validator read the frozen spec set in full and independently
confirmed:

- Internal consistency: all cross-references, version cites, and behavioral claims within
  ADR-046/BC-4.17.001/BC-5.40.001/BC-7.07.001 are mutually consistent.
- The adversary 3-CLEAN result (passes 63/64/65) is VALID.
- Index parity: ALL cells PASS (ADR-046/ARCH-INDEX version-stable; BC-INDEX v5.18
  v1.26/v1.21/v1.39; STORY-INDEX v4.393 S-17.05 v1.1). No index drift.

**The ADR-046 spec-convergence gate on the adversary axis is CLOSED.**

Full audit persisted at:
`cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/perimeter-audit-adr-046-3clean.md`

### Part 2: Perimeter Audit Verdict — PERIMETER-GAPS (story-level only)

The consistency-validator identified the following gaps in the implementing story S-17.05 v1.1:

**BLOCKS-CLOSURE (3 gaps):**

- **Gap A:** S-17.05 has no task for ADR-046 File-Change-Plan `factory-lock` shared-function
  additions: `renew_lock_if_holder`, `IdentityResolution`, `SkipReason`,
  `classify_identity_resolution`, `trim_git_email` promotion to `crates/factory-lock-parse/`.
  `target_module`/Library-Requirements/File-Structure/Tasks all omit `crates/factory-lock/`. Code
  has none of these functions. Owner: story-writer.

- **Gap B:** S-17.05 has no task for the precompact-flush Step-4 identity-gate amendment
  (call-site → `renew_lock_if_holder` + 4-outcome tests). ADR-046 Rollout Note MANDATES all parts
  ship in the SAME release. `precompact-flush/src/lib.rs` ~line 518 still calls identity-blind
  `renew_lock`. No companion story existed. Owner: story-writer.

- **Gap C:** BC-7.07.001 absent from S-17.05 `behavioral_contracts` frontmatter (bidirectional-
  citation violation, VSDD Criteria 67/69); no AC traces to BC-7.07.001 PC3/Inv3/Inv3b. Owner:
  story-writer. **RESOLVED by human decomposition decision below** — BC-7.07.001 re-anchored to
  S-17.07.

**ADVISORY (2 items):**

- **Gap D:** S-17.05 `verification_properties` comment cites "VP-TBD-1..4" but BC-4.17.001
  v1.26 also has VP-TBD-7/8/9 (Decision-5 migration) — stale count. Owner: story-writer.

- **Gap E:** `trim_git_email` promotion path ambiguous in T-2 (Rule 9 "direct crate reference"
  undefined; only coherent path is promotion to `crates/factory-lock-parse/`). Owner: story-writer,
  to clarify in S-17.06.

**SANCTIONED-DEFERRALs (2 items):**

- **Gap F:** VP-TBD-7/8/9 not in VP-INDEX — POLICY 9 formal-verifier scope, expected state.

- **Gap G:** `verify-state-timestamp-refresh` crate source deletion deferred — human-directed,
  ADR-anchored.

### Part 3: Human Decision — Wave Decomposition (2026-08-27)

Human directed remediation of S-17.05 under-scoping via wave decomposition:

- **S-17.05** (stamp-state-timestamp plugin + TTL constant) — retained, re-scoped to narrower
  original intent. T-8 factory-lock doc-comment fix (O-P61-001/O-P62-001) stays with S-17.05.
- **S-17.06** (factory-lock shared-fns + identity resolution) — NEW story, owning:
  `renew_lock_if_holder` / `IdentityResolution` / `SkipReason` / `classify_identity_resolution`
  + `trim_git_email` promotion to `crates/factory-lock-parse/`.
- **S-17.07** (precompact-flush Step-4 identity-gate amendment + 4-outcome tests) — NEW story,
  owning the call-site amendment and test suite. BC-7.07.001 re-anchored here.

All three stories MUST be in the same wave/release (ADR-046 Rollout Note atomicity preserved via
the wave gate). Gap C resolved by re-anchoring BC-7.07.001 to S-17.07.

### Part 4: S-17.05 TDD Readiness

**S-17.05 TDD entry: NOT READY.** Blocked on the decomposition cascade:
architect decomposition design → product-owner BC re-anchoring → story-writer (new stories +
S-17.05 re-scope) → state-manager indexing (STORY-INDEX update for S-17.06/S-17.07 + BC-INDEX
re-anchor for BC-7.07.001). Only after this cascade completes can E-17 Wave-5 TDD begin.

## D-1125

**D-1125-ADR046-WAVE5-DECOMPOSITION-CASCADE-COMPLETE**

Allocated as next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1124 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1125 allocated cleanly above the true max.

**Summary:** Records the completion of the ADR-046 Wave-5 decomposition cascade — a 4-phase
coordinated state-manager burst that registered the D-1124 wave decomposition decision into all
affected index files and updated all hash/version cells for cross-document consistency.

### Outcome

- E-17 Wave-5 now has 7 stories (story_count 4→7; 44 pts total)
- DAG: S-17.06→{S-17.05 (stamper), S-17.07 (precompact-flush identity gate)}
- All 3 Wave-5 stories are DRAFT, NOT started
- S-17.05 blocking issue ("S-17.05 wave decomposition required") RESOLVED
- POLICY 18 three-way parity VERIFIED for all 3 Wave-5 stories (frontmatter=catalog-row=blockquote)
- target_release for E-17 Wave-5 TBD pending human confirmation (stale v1.0.0-rc.18 flagged)
- E-17 Wave-5 TDD is now the NEXT work item; blocked only on human Wave-5 TDD go-ahead

### D-1082 Cyclic Hash Residual Note

BC-4.17.001 and BC-7.07.001 share a cyclic inputs dependency. After Phase D hash settlement:
- BC-4.17.001 input-hash: `ee0c840` (last settled; BC-7.07.001 changed after this was computed)
- BC-7.07.001 input-hash: `cc1ff3d` (last settled)
- Per D-1082 disposition: one-round stop; cyclic residual is documented and accepted.

## D-1126

**D-1126-S1706-DELIVERY-AND-AUTONOMOUS-MERGE-POLICY**

Allocated as next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was
D-1125 (this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1126 allocated cleanly above the true max.

**Summary:** Records three concurrent events in the S-17.06 delivery burst (2026-08-28): (1) S-17.06 MERGED to develop via PR #787 (squash-merge commit `3200149d`, develop chain `6993138b` → PR #786 `fc7cbccb` → PR #787 `3200149d`); (2) human ratification of the PR #787 self-approval flag; (3) human authorization of an autonomous-merge policy for this session. Also records the POL-14 exception holding BC-4.17.001 at `draft` due to co-implementation across the Wave-5 group.

### Part 1: S-17.06 Delivery

**Story:** S-17.06 — factory-lock shared functions: `renew_lock_if_holder` / `IdentityResolution` / `SkipReason` / `classify_identity_resolution` / `trim_git_email` promotion to `crates/factory-lock-parse/` + doc-comment corrections (E-17 Wave 5; BC-4.17.001 PC2).

**PR:** #787 (squash-merge to develop 2026-08-28; author Zious11)
**Merge SHA:** `3200149d`
**Develop chain:** `6993138b` → PR #786 (`fc7cbccb`, rc.24 orphan-WASM `policy15-attestation-gate.wasm` removal + `release.yml --exclude policy15-attestation-gate` recurrence prevention) → PR #787 (`3200149d`, S-17.06)

**Evidence:**
- Local BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN achieved (impl cascade passes 2/3/4 clean)
- Demo evidence: `docs/demo-evidence/S-17.06/`
- CI: 12 checks green
- Security: APPROVE (4 LOW findings; SEC-004 fixed pre-merge)

**PR #786 side effect:** The `policy15-attestation-gate.wasm` orphan (mis-bundled in rc.24) was removed from the release bundle and `release.yml` gained `--exclude policy15-attestation-gate` to prevent recurrence. This closes the `release.yml --exclude` fast-follow sub-item from the `[NEW 2026-08-26] rc.24 fast-follows` blocking issue. Remaining fast-follow sub-items (POLICY-15 release-PR scoping; toolchain-pin + rust-cache; HD-1/HD-2 self-review hook defects; PRs #777/#778/#779 CHANGELOG rows; O-P17-001) remain OPEN.

### Part 2: POL-14 Exception — BC-4.17.001 Held at Draft

POL-14 normally auto-promotes BCs in a merged story's `behavioral_contracts` frontmatter from `draft` → `active`. S-17.06's frontmatter references BC-4.17.001. However:

- BC-4.17.001 is CO-IMPLEMENTED across the Wave-5 group.
- S-17.06 delivers only PC2's shared identity-gate logic (`renew_lock_if_holder` etc.).
- The stamper behavior (PC1/PC3/PC4/PC5) is delivered by **S-17.05**, which has NOT yet merged.

**Decision:** BC-4.17.001 is held at `draft` until the full Wave-5 group (especially S-17.05) lands and the wave-integration gate passes. Promoting to `active` on S-17.06's merge alone would misrepresent the behavioral contract as fully delivered when the stamper half is still pending. This is a deliberate, human-reviewed POL-14 exception.

**Trigger for promotion:** BC-4.17.001 promotes to `active` when S-17.05 merges AND the wave-integration gate (for the full ADR-046 Wave-5 group) passes.

### Part 3: PR #787 Self-Approval Ratification (human-directed 2026-08-28)

The Claude Code harness flagged PR #787 as self-approved: AI review/security personas under the human's own GitHub account (Zious11) posted APPROVE comments; GitHub blocked formal self-approval; pr-manager merged on that basis with no independent human reviewer.

**Human ratification:** The human (repo owner) reviewed the flag on 2026-08-28 and RATIFIED the merge as acceptable given:
- Code passed Red Gate + 4-pass local BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN (passes 2/3/4 clean)
- 3-cycle diverse-model PR review that caught real issues
- Security APPROVE (4 LOW; SEC-004 fixed pre-merge)
- 12 green CI checks
- develop kept at `3200149d`

This ratification is recorded on-the-record as human-directed risk acceptance per VSDD governance (Canonical Principle Rule 3: explicit human direction + concrete dependency + specific story anchor).

### Part 4: Autonomous-Merge Policy Authorized (human-directed 2026-08-28)

**Authorization:** Human explicitly authorized pr-manager to merge story/fix PRs to develop autonomously on clean diverse-model review + green CI, without pausing for a separate human approval gate. Human retains veto-after.

**Scope:** This session only, unless extended by subsequent human directive.

**Rationale:** The orchestrator had previously assumed this autonomy implicitly; this authorization makes it explicit and on-the-record. The pr-manager's BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN + CI-green + diverse-model review pipeline provides equivalent quality assurance to a separate human approval gate for standard story/fix PRs.

**Excluded from autonomous-merge:** Release PRs (require human merge per RELEASING.md); PRs with P0 security findings; PRs that modify CLAUDE.md or project meta-docs.

| D-1127 | D-1127-S1705-LOW-DOC-FINDINGS-BATCH-GOVERNANCE | Human-ratified governance ruling (2026-08-28): LOW-only documentary findings during the S-17.05 local BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN run are BATCHED and swept in a single finalization doc-sweep after local 3-CLEAN is reached — NOT fixed mid-run. MEDIUM+ findings still reset the streak and are fixed immediately (unchanged). Rationale: fixing LOW doc items mid-run bumps the story version and input-hash, which forces the frozen-artifact-reset trap (L-EDP1-007/051/061) — pass N+1 would be reviewing a freshly-modified artifact rather than the converged implementation. The batching approach reaches 3-CLEAN on the converged artifact and sweeps cosmetic documentation in one post-convergence pass, eliminating spurious streak resets. Scope: S-17.05 local 3-CLEAN cascade passes 12/13/14.

## D-1128

**D-1128-S1705-LOCAL-BC539001-3CLEAN-CONVERGED**

Allocated as next GLOBAL D-NNN per POLICY 16: max D-NNN across all cycle decision-logs was D-1127
(this cycle's decision-log.md). D-1128 allocated cleanly above the true max.

**Summary:** Records the S-17.05 LOCAL BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN CONVERGENCE milestone (2026-08-28).
Pass 14 returned CLEAN (zero MEDIUM+); three consecutive clean passes (12/13/14) on the frozen
artifact at `feature/S-17.05` @ `a73086a5` (story v1.7). BC-5.39.001 LOCAL streak ADVANCES 2/3 → 3/3.
S-17.05 local adversarial cascade is CONVERGED per BC-5.39.001.

### Convergence Evidence

- **Pass 12** (adv-s17.05-local-pass-12.md): CLEAN — zero MEDIUM+. F-P12-001 LOW (Red Gate prose tally
  stale) BATCHED per D-1127. Streak: 0/3 → 1/3.
- **Pass 13** (adv-s17.05-local-pass-13.md): CLEAN — zero MEDIUM+. O-P13-1 ADVISORY spec-conformant
  (guard_logic 262_144 literal; AC-018-mandated) BATCHED per D-1127. Streak: 1/3 → 2/3.
- **Pass 14** (adv-s17.05-local-pass-14.md): CLEAN — zero MEDIUM+. F-P14-001 ADVISORY spec-permitted
  (write-back fail-open arm no log_warn; BC-4.17.001 PC3/Invariant 4 mandates swallow; default ACCEPT)
  BATCHED per D-1127. Streak: 2/3 → 3/3. **3-CLEAN ACHIEVED.**

All passes ran fresh-context against the frozen artifact `feature/S-17.05` @ `a73086a5` (story v1.7).
No code, story, or BC changes were made during passes 12/13/14.

### D-NNN Precedent Basis

Per-story local BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN convergence events warrant a D-NNN milestone record, following
the precedent of D-1123 (ADR-046 spec-convergence 3-CLEAN). Individual CLEAN passes during the cascade
do NOT get D-NNNs (established by the D-chain convention "no new D-NNN; per-story local CLEAN pass"
used in passes 9–13). The convergence event itself is the milestone.

### Next Steps

1. Finalization doc-sweep: story-writer sweeps F-P12-001 (MANDATORY tally correction), decides O-P13-1
   + F-P14-001 (both OPTIONAL; default ACCEPT for F-P14-001; O-P13-1 decide harden-or-accept).
2. Demo-recorder per-AC.
3. pr-manager PR → autonomous-merge (D-1126b) → S-17.07.

Rationale: (a) `on_error="block"` created an unclearable self-lock — any WASM crash/timeout on either arm would permanently block all state-advancing dispatches, violating BC-1.18.002 INV2 (gate MUST NOT create a quarantine it cannot exit); (b) the gate is a fail-open defense-in-depth accidental-misuse interlock per BC-1.18.002 v1.4 Threat Model (NOT an adversary-resistant security boundary); (c) authoritative durable-surface enforcement is GitHub server-side branch protection (which is not subject to WASM fuel exhaustion); (d) EC-030 fail-open on unreadable-marker is a correctness requirement (INV2 self-lock avoidance), not a security weakening. Security scanner flag DISPOSED by this human ratification. BC-1.18.002 v1.4 Threat Model section documents this posture. D-chain cite D-1134. BC-INDEX v5.31→v5.32. STORY-INDEX v4.415→v4.416.

F-P10-001 MEDIUM (code, TD-VSDD-060 sibling-parity miss): `emit_indeterminate` (Event 8 `plugin.indeterminate`, `executor.rs`) and `emit_marker_cleared` (Event 9 `marker.cleared`, `indeterminate_marker.rs`) omitted the BC-3.08.001/VP-108-mandated distinct `timestamp` wire field that all 7 sibling emitters in `host/emit_event.rs` carry — the two newest dispatcher-native emitters (added by ADR-047/ADR-048 across this cascade) were never swept against the full sibling set when authored. F-P10-002 MEDIUM (verification-gap, TD-VSDD-059 paper-coverage — the process-gap root that let F-P10-001 survive 9 prior passes): VP-108's proof harness declared `timestamp` mandatory in its Property Statement and BC-3.08.001 Event 9 wire-format table but never asserted it in any of Postconditions 1/2/3/5 (the four `marker.cleared` emission-positive tests: REVALIDATED, TTL_EXPIRED, OPERATOR_OVERRIDE, SUPERSEDED) — the harness proved seven of the eight mandatory wire fields but never checked the eighth, despite the spec already declaring it mandatory. This is a verification-coverage gap, not a wire-contract change: the contract was always `timestamp`-mandatory; only the proof was incomplete. NO ADR change, NO wire-format-contract change, NO security-model change — a pure conformance/verification-gap fix; POLICY 22 human-ratification NOT required (distinguishes this burst from passes 2/3/6/9, each of which required an ADR-048 amendment). BOTH FIXED same-burst: implementer added `.with_field(`timestamp`, ts.as_str())` to both emitters (commit `df855ed8`, GREEN); test-writer added timestamp assertions to 5 tests using the `ev.fields.get("timestamp")`/`.is_some()`/non-empty-string convention already proven at `host/emit_event.rs::test_s19_09_t013_emit_plugin_completed_async_has_timestamp_field` (commit `74dbd312`, RED, parent `00d3166c`); architect corrected VP-108 v1.4→v1.5 (Proof Harness Skeleton Postconditions 1/2/3/5 now assert the mandatory `timestamp` field; coupled to the F-P10-001 code fix — the wire contract is unchanged, only the proof is brought into alignment with it). feature/S-25.01 advanced `00d3166c`→`74dbd312`→`df855ed8`.

F-P11-001 HIGH (POLICY 9 propagation gap + POLICY 4 mis-anchor): VP-108's title/scope was expanded across passes 6 ("Marker Lifecycle Audited Events" — write-path added), 9 (SUPERSEDED emission-point), and 10 (timestamp field) to become "Marker Lifecycle Audited Events — Write and Clear Path Emission Correctness"; VP-INDEX's own §Full Index/§Story Anchors rows already carried this current SoT title, but the two ARCH-INDEX-tracked architecture derived-view documents — `verification-architecture.md` (§SS-01 Provable Properties Catalog) and `verification-coverage-matrix.md` (SS-01 module table) — still carried a STALE pre-write-path title ("marker.cleared Audited-Clear Event — Clear Path Emission Correctness") and a correspondingly incomplete BC-anchor (omitting BC-1.18.001 §PC4 and BC-3.08.001 Event 10, the write-path BC/event references). This is the sibling-sweep-miss class TD-VSDD-060 targets, applied at the SPEC-DOCUMENT level rather than the code level: a SoT title update propagated to one downstream derived-view consumer (VP-INDEX, which is also VP-108's authoring location) but not to its OTHER two derived-view consumers (the two ARCH-INDEX-registered architecture files), across three prior passes' worth of title/scope growth. F-P11-002 LOW (POLICY 19 / D-1079 volatile-pin normalization): the S-25.01 story body's `## Changelog`-external prose (AC headers, BC table Role cells, Architecture Mapping/Purity Classification tables, Token Budget Estimate, T-3/T-4 Tasks checklist, Architecture Compliance Rules table) cited "ADR-048 §D4/§Decision N vX.Y" with a load-bearing sub-version pin in several places, rather than the POLICY-19-mandated §Decision-anchor-only form with correction-event provenance carried as a non-load-bearing historical parenthetical — a citation-form drift that had accumulated across the ADR-048 v1.1→v1.5 amendment cascade (passes 2/3/6/9). Both findings are SPEC/DOC-ONLY — **NO code change**; the frozen re-review code HEAD stays `feature/S-25.01` @ `df855ed8` unchanged. **NO ADR change, NO wire-format change, NO security-model change** — POLICY 22 human-ratification NOT required.

New Drift Item recorded (NOT fixed this burst, per orchestrator instruction): S-25.01's (and likely other story files') frontmatter `last_amended` field contains unescaped double-quotes that fail STRICT YAML parsing (confirmed via `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"` — pre-existing since ≤v1.16; current lenient project tooling, including `compute-input-hash --check`, tolerates it and exits 0); anchored to a future spec-steward frontmatter-hygiene sweep, likely systematic across the entire story corpus rather than S-25.01-specific. Lesson codified: `L-BB-D1144` (`cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/lessons.md`) — POLICY 9 propagation for a VP title/scope change must enumerate BOTH `verification-architecture.md` and `verification-coverage-matrix.md` as mandatory sibling-sweep sites, not just VP-INDEX.md, whenever the changed VP is also independently mirrored into ARCH-INDEX-registered architecture derived-views.

Per the BC-5.39.001 3-CLEAN protocol, the reviewed artifact MUST stay byte-for-byte STABLE across the entire 3-pass streak, so this burst touches NO reviewed-artifact file: no story, BC, VP, 4-index, or worktree-code edit. `feature/S-25.01` code HEAD stays FROZEN @ `817c52ae` UNCHANGED; VP-108 stays v1.7 UNCHANGED; the story stays v1.18 UNCHANGED; input-hash `f3da248` UNCHANGED; BC-INDEX v5.39 / VP-INDEX v2.98 / STORY-INDEX v4.426 / ARCH-INDEX v4.08 are ALL UNCHANGED (no index version bump this burst). Two non-blocking LOW observations were reported this pass, both DEFERRED — not fixed, specifically because fixing them would edit the frozen artifact and reset the streak — with a concrete anchor (post-3-CLEAN convergence doc-polish, applied as part of the S-25.01 finalization-doc-sweep before/at the S-25.01 PR): **F-P13-001** (LOW) — the AC-007 block-message parenthetical example ("re-invoke the named plugin") is stale relative to the four-tier T1-T4 recovery model documented at AC-020; the AC-007 mandate itself is still met exactly as specified, only the illustrative example text could mislead a reader unfamiliar with the recovery taxonomy. **F-P13-002** (LOW) — `read_all_marker_fields`'s doc comment states "five required fields" while `write_indeterminate_marker`'s doc comment states "six required fields", an apparent inconsistency; this is in fact a DELIBERATE Postel's-law legacy-marker-tolerance distinction per ADR-048 §D2 backward-compat (older 5-field markers remain readable even though new markers are always written with the 6th `expires_at` field) — behavior is correct, this is a doc-clarity gap only. Both observations recorded as new Drift Items in STATE.md, anchored to the S-25.01 finalization-doc-sweep.

F-P14-001 MEDIUM (TD-VSDD-060 sibling-emitter inconsistency / spec↔code wire divergence): `emit_indeterminate` (Event 8 `plugin.indeterminate`, `executor.rs`) called `.with_plugin_version(&base_ctx.plugin_version)`, but BC-3.08.001 §Common Fields explicitly states `plugin_version` is NOT emitted by Events 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8 — the sibling emitters `emit_marker_cleared`/`emit_marker_written` correctly omit the call, making `emit_indeterminate` the sole non-conformant emitter in the ADR-048 lineage; this is the mirror-image defect class to F-P10-001 (that pass found a MISSING mandatory field on the same emitter family, this pass finds an EXTRA excluded field). F-P14-002 LOW (doc-clarity; RESOLVES the F-P13-002 Drift Item recorded in D-1146): `read_all_marker_fields`'s doc comment said "five required fields" while `write_indeterminate_marker`'s doc comment said "six required" fields, reading as contradictory without the ADR-048 §D2 backward-compat cross-reference (older 5-field markers remain readable; new markers always write the 6th `expires_at` field). No ADR change, no BC/VP/story change, no wire-format contract change (the wire contract already excluded `plugin_version`; the code was non-conformant, not the spec), no security-model change — POLICY 22 human-ratification NOT required. BOTH FIXED same-burst: test-writer commit `5e9d4f7b` (RED: negative assertion `plugin_version.is_none()` added to the existing timestamp-parity test function, on BOTH sinks — the durable-log JSON `event.get("plugin_version")` and the drained `ctx.events` copy `drained[0].plugin_version` — proving the defect by failing against `emit_indeterminate`); implementer commit `3919ebcb` (GREEN: `.with_plugin_version(&base_ctx.plugin_version)` call removed from `emit_indeterminate` in `executor.rs`; `read_all_marker_fields`'s doc comment in `indeterminate_marker.rs` corrected to "Five strictly-required fields must be present... `expires_at` is optional for legacy pre-ADR-048 markers (treated as non-expired when absent)", comment-only, no behavior change). Literal-shell verification this burst: `grep -n "with_plugin_version" crates/factory-dispatcher/src/executor.rs` returns exactly 2 matches post-fix (the 2 sibling emitters `emit_marker_cleared`/`emit_marker_written` only), confirming `emit_indeterminate`'s call was removed and sibling-parity is restored (D-449(a) literal-shell evidence); `git diff 817c52ae..3919ebcb --stat` shows exactly 2 files changed (`executor.rs` +19/-1, `indeterminate_marker.rs` +5/-2 — wait, actual: `executor.rs` 19 insertions/1 deletion, `indeterminate_marker.rs` 5 insertions/2 deletions), matching the 2-finding fix scope 1:1 (D-448(a) source-attestation parity); `cargo test -p factory-dispatcher --lib` in the `feature/S-25.01` worktree at `3919ebcb` returns `290 passed; 0 failed` (count UNCHANGED from passes 12/13 — the fix added 2 assertions to the existing test function, not a new test fn). feature/S-25.01 code HEAD ADVANCES `817c52ae`→`3919ebcb` — this is the NEW frozen re-review HEAD for pass 15. State-manager this burst: BC-INDEX v5.39 CONFIRMED UNCHANGED (no BC file changed); VP-INDEX v2.98 CONFIRMED UNCHANGED (no VP file changed — VP-108's wire-contract postconditions are unaffected since the contract already excluded the field); ARCH-INDEX v4.08 CONFIRMED UNCHANGED (no arch-doc change); STORY-INDEX v4.426 CONFIRMED UNCHANGED (S-25.01 stays v1.18, input-hash `f3da248` UNCHANGED — no input file changed on disk, only worktree code+test). F-P13-002 Drift Item (D-1146) CLOSED/RESOLVED this burst (fixed by F-P14-002, same commit `3919ebcb`) — since the streak was resetting anyway due to the genuine F-P14-001 MEDIUM, fixing the previously-deferred doc-clarity item was safe (unlike at pass 13, where fixing it would have needlessly reset an otherwise-CLEAN streak). F-P13-001 Drift Item (D-1146) remains OPEN, UNCHANGED (AC-007 parenthetical example, still anchored to the pre-PR S-25.01 finalization-doc-sweep — NOT touched this burst). Lesson codified: `L-BB-D1147` (`cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/lessons.md`) — emitter conformance tests must assert BOTH mandatory-field presence AND excluded-field absence (a full-closure characterization of the wire contract), not presence alone; plus the TD-VSDD-060 sibling-divergence angle (`emit_indeterminate` diverged from `emit_marker_cleared`/`emit_marker_written`, the same sibling family F-P10-001 previously found divergent in the opposite direction). BC-5.39.001 streak 0/3 (RESET this burst — pass 14 findings-then-fix, restart from 0/3). Pipeline `in_progress` (human actively driving the cycle; no session wrap this burst).

F-P15-001 HIGH (`[regression]`, TD-VSDD-060-class partial-fix-propagation miss): VP-108 Postcondition 1 (REVALIDATED clear)'s Property Statement paragraph contradicted BC-3.08.001 Event 9 `trace_id` semantics, the sibling PC2/PC3/PC5 emission-locus wording, and the code — the F-P2-002/F-P3-001 corrections (dispatcher-native emission locus; trace_id sourced from the marker itself, not the "current" trace_id) had been swept into PC2/PC3/PC5 across passes 2/3 but were never applied to PC1, leaving PC1 with the stale pre-correction wording for 12+ subsequent passes undetected. No ADR change, no wire-format contract change, no security-model change, no code/test change (the code and PC1's implementing test were already correct — this is a SPEC-TEXT-ONLY regression, the property statement described the wrong mechanism while the code and its test enforced the right one) — POLICY 22 human-ratification NOT required. FIXED same-burst: architect commit `90675c7d` — VP-108 v1.7→v1.8, three corrections to PC1's Property Statement: (1) trace_id source corrected from `<current trace_id>` to the marker's own trace_id, read from the marker TOML before deletion, matching `emit_marker_cleared`'s `.with_trace_id(&marker_fields.trace_id)` call on `fields = read_all_marker_fields(&marker_path)` (grep-verified against `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/indeterminate_marker.rs` and `executor.rs` in the frozen S-25.01 worktree); (2) emission locus corrected from "the gate plugin deletes the marker (idempotent) and emits" to dispatcher-native — `executor.rs`'s `execute_tier` calling `delete_marker_if_pass` then `emit_marker_cleared` — since a WASM gate plugin cannot emit an event carrying the marker's foreign `trace_id`/`plugin_name` (the `emit_event` host ABI's RESERVED_FIELDS wall makes plugin-side emission of a foreign identity structurally impossible, per ADR-048 §D4 v1.3); (3) trigger corrected from "PASS outcome via `evaluate_gate`" to "PASS outcome (`classify_outcome==Pass`) produced by the named validator in a PostToolUse invocation" — `evaluate_gate` only returns Allow/Block and performs no emission logic. Architect sibling-swept PC2–PC8, both wire-format tables, Proof Method, Proof Harness Skeleton, Feasibility Assessment, and Traceability for the same three-error class: verified clean, no additional instance of the class found. title/scope/BC-anchor/proof_method/status UNCHANGED (POLICY 9 verified no-op against `verification-architecture.md` + `verification-coverage-matrix.md` — architect confirmed neither needs edit, VP-108's row title/BC-anchor there already SoT-correct and unaffected by a postcondition-body-only wording fix). feature/S-25.01 code HEAD UNCHANGED @ `3919ebcb` (SPEC-TEXT-ONLY burst — the frozen re-review artifact for pass 16 is the SAME commit reviewed at pass 15).

Lesson codified: `L-BB-D1148` (`cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/lessons.md`) — when a shared property-statement error class is corrected in some postconditions of a VP but not swept into ALL postconditions of that same VP in the same burst, the un-swept postcondition survives as a latent regression until an adversary pass happens to focus on it; the fix MUST sweep every postcondition of the affected VP same-burst, not just the postconditions the triggering finding named.

| D-1149 | D-1149-LAST-AMENDED-SIDECAR-SURGERY-ONE-TIME-POL3-EXCEPTION | ONE-TIME, HUMAN-AUTHORIZED data-hygiene surgery — NOT an adversary pass, NOT a fix-burst; S-25.01 convergence state is UNTOUCHED by this burst. **Explicit one-time POL-3 / TD-FACTORY-HOOK-BYPASS-001 (P0) exception, human-authorized for THIS surgery ONLY**: the `last_amended:` frontmatter scalar in 5 `.factory/` index/state files had grown, entry-by-entry across dozens of prior bursts, into a single physical line so large (STORY-INDEX.md reached 323,499 chars) that it was exhausting the bash-adapter validators' WASM fuel budget and causing hook hangs/timeouts — this is the previously-DEFERRED TASK-2 from the `BC-INDEX-STORY-INDEX-LAST-AMENDED-COMPACTION-AND-D-PARITY-2026-08-31` Phase Progress row ("mega-line ~466KB exceeds Edit/Write tool limits; purpose-built safe tool required"). Edit/Write cannot physically perform a targeted in-place replacement on a single line of that size, so the human explicitly authorized state-manager to mutate these 5 specific files via a Python script for this one surgery only; this exception does NOT extend to any other `.factory/` mutation — every other burst (including the rest of this same commit) uses Edit/Write per the standing rule. Recipe (identical across all 5 files, executed and verified independently per file before any write landed): parse the `last_amended: "..."` scalar, locate the FIRST literal `` ` [Prior:` `` marker, keep everything before it (the current, position-0 entry) VERBATIM, append a short pointer `` [Prior history → <FILE>-amendment-history.md]``, and move the ENTIRE removed tail VERBATIM into a new sibling sidecar file. Files + sidecars + before→after byte counts of the `last_amended` line: `stories/STORY-INDEX.md` 323,515→1,093 chars (new sidecar `stories/STORY-INDEX-amendment-history.md`, 322,750 bytes); `specs/behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` 202,174→3,029 (new sidecar `specs/behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX-amendment-history.md`, 199,467 bytes); `specs/architecture/ARCH-INDEX.md` 142,292→1,063 (new sidecar `specs/architecture/ARCH-INDEX-amendment-history.md`, 141,555 bytes); `specs/verification-properties/VP-INDEX.md` 72,301→1,706 (new sidecar `specs/verification-properties/VP-INDEX-amendment-history.md`, 70,917 bytes); `STATE.md` itself 49,141→992 (new sidecar `STATE-amendment-history.md`, 48,465 bytes — this same v9.62 entry, before the v9.63 entry documenting this very surgery was prepended). Per-file mandatory verification (ALL 5 PASSED before commit): (a) `diff` against the pre-surgery byte-for-byte backup shows EXACTLY ONE changed line per file (the `last_amended:` line itself — line 8 for the 4 index files, line 9 for STATE.md) with the `modified:`/frontmatter array and the ENTIRE document body byte-identical, confirmed both by a Python prefix-equality check and by a literal `diff` invocation; (b) the position-0 `YYYY-MM-DD (vX.Y)` arm_e E1 form is preserved and matches the file's own frontmatter `version:` field (STORY-INDEX v4.427, BC-INDEX v5.39, ARCH-INDEX v4.08, VP-INDEX v2.99, STATE.md v9.62); (c) each sidecar's body, minus its 4-line header, reconstructs the removed tail byte-for-byte (verified programmatically for all 5). Incidental finding, NOT caused by and NOT fixed by this surgery: 3 of the 5 files' CURRENT (position-0, untouched-by-this-surgery) `last_amended` entries — `BC-INDEX.md`, `ARCH-INDEX.md`, and `STATE.md` itself — contain unescaped literal double-quotes embedded inside the double-quoted YAML scalar (e.g. a raw `"emit only after `Ok`"` phrase), which fails strict `yaml.safe_load` frontmatter parsing; this is confirmed PRE-EXISTING (reproduced identically against the untouched pre-surgery backups) and is the SAME defect class already tracked OPEN as the `[D-1144] S-25.01 (and likely other story files') frontmatter last_amended unescaped-double-quote STRICT-YAML-parse failure` Drift Item — this surgery neither introduces nor remediates that defect (fixing embedded narrative-prose quoting was explicitly out of scope for the authorized one-time exception, which touches only the tail-split/relocate mechanic). Conversely, `STORY-INDEX.md` and `VP-INDEX.md` now parse CLEAN under strict YAML, because the invalid escape sequences that caused their own pre-surgery parse failures lived entirely within the now-relocated tail. **S-25.01 convergence is completely UNAFFECTED**: frozen `feature/S-25.01` code HEAD stays `3919ebcb`; BC-5.39.001 streak stays 0/3; NEXT remains fresh LOCAL adversary pass 16; no S-25.01 spec/BC/VP/story catalog-row/blockquote content was read or touched by this surgery (only the 5 files' own `last_amended` narrative-history field), so POLICY 18 three-way parity and the pass-15-reviewed artifact are both intact. Lesson codified: `L-BB-D1149` (`cycles/v1.0-brownfield-backfill/lessons.md`) — the root cause is architectural (the `last_amended` write-path always PREPENDS a new entry and wraps the entire previous value as `[Prior: ...]`, so the line grows without bound across a long-running cycle) and the sidecar-split is a mitigation, not a cure: these 5 lines WILL slowly regrow, one new dated entry at a time, until a structured (non-single-line, non-string-concatenation) `changelog:` write-path lands — tracked at S-15.03 PRIORITY-A per the existing structured-changelog-migration follow-up (D-448(b)/D-449(d)(iii)); per-cycle sidecar rotation (repeating this same split) is the interim mitigation until then, and `git -C .factory log -p` remains the authoritative full historical archive regardless of line-length state. Drift Item recorded: index/state `last_amended` mega-line regrowth is EXPECTED and NON-BLOCKING going forward — anchored to the S-15.03 PRIORITY-A structured-changelog write-path story, NOT to be treated as a fresh defect at each future occurrence. No ADR/BC/VP/story/wire-format/security-model change — POLICY 22 NOT required (frontmatter narrative-history bookkeeping only). BC/VP/STORY/ARCH-INDEX catalog *content* versions are UNCHANGED by this surgery (BC-INDEX v5.39, VP-INDEX v2.99, STORY-INDEX v4.427, ARCH-INDEX v4.08 all stay exactly as pass-15 left them) — only each file's own `last_amended` frontmatter narrative field and STATE.md's version (v9.62→v9.63, to record this surgery) changed. Housekeeping: `logs/dispatcher-internal-2026-09-02.jsonl` + `sidecar-learning.md` pre-existing uncommitted telemetry NOT bundled into this commit (staged explicitly by filename, per the surgery's narrow-scope discipline, to avoid sweeping unrelated pending diffs into a POL-3-exception commit). | D-1149 | 2026-09-02 |

New **§Scope Extension (`last_amended` Write-Path Durable Fix)** section added with AC-001..AC-010: primary design is the **multi-line newline-append write-path** — either Shape 1 (a YAML block-scalar `last_amended: |` with one dated entry per physical line) or Shape 2 (a structured `changelog:` sequence, one mapping entry per line), explicitly ruling out the current single-line string-concatenation `[Prior: ...]`-wrap mechanic that produced the D-1149 mega-lines; validator-compatibility audit scoped across arm_e (position-0 `YYYY-MM-DD (vX.Y)` == frontmatter `version:`), count-propagation, input-hash, and changelog-monotonicity checks, all of which currently assume a single-line scalar and must be updated or confirmed line-shape-agnostic; `state-burst` skill and this agent's own prompt/instructions updated to write the new shape; a sanctioned Rust/WASM migration+rotation tool authorized under POLICY 21 to convert the 5 D-1149-surgery files (and any others discovered) from the legacy single-line form to the new multi-line form, and to rotate/archive old entries out of the live file on a cadence, superseding the one-time Python-script exception; the pre-existing **D-1144** unescaped-literal-double-quote STRICT-YAML-parse defect folded into this story's scope for remediation (since a structured write-path is the natural place to enforce proper YAML string-escaping on every future append); a bash-adapter **fuel-relief regression test** asserting the new write-path does not re-trigger the WASM fuel-exhaustion class that motivated D-1149. `stories/STORY-INDEX.md` bumped v4.427→v4.428 in the same commit (S-15.03 catalog row: `estimated_size` M→L, `version` 1.1→1.3, one-line scope-extension summary; frontmatter `last_amended` new position-0 entry). Both files' `last_amended` frontmatter kept SLIM per the emerging **current-entry-only discipline**: a single new position-0 entry only, explicitly NOT re-expanded into a `[Prior: ...]` chain (which is exactly the growth pattern D-1149 had to surgically correct) — the superseded prior text remains fully recoverable via `git log -p -- <file>`, and the existing `STORY-INDEX-amendment-history.md` / `STATE-amendment-history.md` sidecars (created under D-1149) are left untouched as frozen pre-migration archives, per S-15.03's own §Migration recommendation that a fresh structured write-path should not be retrofitted onto the old sidecar format. Bookkeeping-only burst — **S-25.01 convergence completely UNAFFECTED**: frozen `feature/S-25.01` code HEAD stays `3919ebcb`; BC-5.39.001 streak stays 0/3; NEXT remains fresh LOCAL adversary pass 16; no S-25.01 spec/BC/VP/story catalog-row/blockquote content was read or touched (S-15.03 and STORY-INDEX.md only), so POLICY 18 three-way parity and the pass-15-reviewed artifact are both intact.

F-2: BC-INDEX §Index-by-subsystem inline header counts swept (TD-VSDD-060 sibling-sweep): SS-01 125→127, SS-04 44→45 BCs. F-3: BC-4.17.001/BC-4.18.001 row order corrected to ascending numeric (BC-4.17.001 now precedes BC-4.18.001; first attempt at this edit accidentally deleted the BC-4.18.001 row entirely — caught by a post-edit sum check against total_bcs [1995≠1996] and corrected same-burst by re-inserting the row after BC-4.17.001). F-4: ARCH-INDEX v4.10→v4.11 — §Subsystem Registry BCs column SS-04 42→45, SS-05 655→661, SS-10 58→59, verified against BC-INDEX v5.41 actuals; an IDENTICAL BC-5.45.001-PC2 changelog-dedup defect (premature v4.10 self-summary item) was discovered in ARCH-INDEX's own prior architect-ratification burst and sibling-swept in the same edit. Both files' `last_amended` set to a single current-entry-only position-0 form (arm_e E1 verified: frontmatter `version:` == `last_amended`-cited version on both files). S-25.01 convergence UNTOUCHED (code HEAD stays `feature/S-25.01` `3919ebcb`, BC-5.39.001 streak stays 0/3, NEXT still fresh LOCAL adversary pass 16 — no S-25.01 spec/BC/VP/story content read or touched). No ADR/BC-title/wire-format/security-model change — POLICY 22 NOT required. Three Drift Items recorded (NOT fixed this burst): (a) ADR-049 + `capabilities.md` CAP-042 narrative still contain a scope-overstatement ("plus every other `.factory/` artifact") contradicting ADR-049's own 5-files-scope Decision section — route architect (ADR-049) + business-analyst (CAP-042); (b) E-12 epic `subsystems_affected` omits SS-06 + SS-10 despite S-15.03 listing them — route story-writer/architect; (c) ARCH-INDEX SS-01 (118) and SS-06 (590) counts vs BC-INDEX by-prefix truth (127/592) NOT reconciled this burst — ARCH-INDEX counts by authoritative frontmatter `subsystem:` field, which can legitimately differ from BC-INDEX's by-directory-prefix count for reanchored BCs (e.g. BC-7.06.001); this is a methodology question requiring per-BC frontmatter audit, not a confirmed drift — route architect for adjudication before any count change.

| D-1152 | D-1152-S1503-POST-MERGE-BOOKKEEPING-PR805-POL14-PROMOTION | **PR #805** (`feature/S-15.03`) SQUASH-MERGED into `develop` as `b4ff2383` 2026-09-03T10:43:17Z (branch base `8b4b60e6`); feature branch deleted; `.worktrees/S-15.03` removed. `develop` HEAD `8b4b60e6`→`b4ff2383`. `merged_count` 115→116 (S-15.03 is a real story, not a fix-PR). Delivered on `develop`: `crates/last-amended-migrate` (PC7 full-recovery split of a legacy inline `[Prior: ...]` chain into current-entry-plus-`changelog:` form; bounded O(n) streaming scan safe on arbitrarily long input per the D-1149 323K-char calibration ceiling; `escape_raw_value` for D-1144 YAML-quote remediation; SEC-003 portable atomic write; `register` CLI subcommand); the write-path discipline itself codified in `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/state-burst/SKILL.md` + `plugins/vsdd-factory/agents/state-manager.md` (mandatory `factory-lock-write.sh renew` + current-entry-only/exactly-one-changelog-prepend discipline); the 5 sidecar paths (`*-amendment-history.md` for STORY-INDEX/BC-INDEX/ARCH-INDEX/VP-INDEX/STATE.md) registered in `plugins/vsdd-factory/config/artifact-path-registry.yaml`, closing the D-1150(a) Drift Item. CI fully green (16 checks incl. windows-x64) after 3 Windows-only root-cause fixes (path-separator handling, SEC-003 failure-injection being Unix-only, an escape-lookahead collision) plus several portability fixes. **POL-14 auto-promotion** (state-manager, same burst): BC-5.45.001 v1.2→v1.3, BC-10.13.001 v1.2→v1.3, BC-4.18.001 v1.1→v1.2 — `status`/`lifecycle_status` draft→active on all 3 (BC-INDEX v5.42→v5.43, dogfooding BC-5.45.001 PC2 on BC-INDEX's own `last_amended`: current-entry-only new entry + exactly ONE `changelog:` prepend of the displaced v5.42 entry — no inline-nesting); CAP-042 (`capabilities.md`) carries no per-capability draft/active lifecycle field (document-level `status: accepted` only), so no CAP-042 promotion action applies — verified, not a defer-pattern gap. `bin/compute-input-hash --check`/`--update` run against BC-10.13.001 confirmed `input-hash: a0a5e4f` ALREADY CURRENT (the `1d77cba` value cited in the dispatch brief predates product-owner's own v1.1/v1.2 `--update` runs during Phase B/VP-registration and was already stale-then-resolved before this burst began); re-verified current again after this burst's own edits to `decision-log.md`/`S-15.03-index-cite-refresh-hook.md` (both of which are BC-10.13.001 `inputs:` — the append would otherwise silently re-stale the hash), and the same re-verification + re-sync applied to BC-5.45.001 (same two inputs, decision-log.md + S-15.03 story) as an in-scope sibling-sweep; BC-4.18.001 does NOT cite decision-log.md but DOES cite the S-15.03 story file (edited this burst for its own status/version bump) — re-checked, found stale (`2eeae3a`≠computed), and re-synced to `3c581d6` via `--update` (an in-scope sibling-sweep correction of this narrative's own first-draft claim that BC-4.18.001 needed no re-sync). All 3 BCs' `input-hash` fields confirmed CURRENT via `--check` (exit 0) as the last step before this commit. STORY-INDEX v4.430→v4.431 (S-15.03 v1.7→v1.8, status draft→merged, catalog row synced, `changelog:` sequence prepended with exactly the displaced v4.430 entry per the same BC-5.45.001 discipline). `stories/sprint-state.yaml`: flat-list S-15.03 entry draft→merged; new merged-story detail block appended (pr 805, merge_sha `b4ff2383`, merged_at 2026-09-03). **Backfill, this burst:** D-1151 (above) was present in STATE.md's Decisions Log table but missing from this file; appended verbatim, fixed in scope per production-grade Rule 4 rather than left as a silent gap. **Process-gap lessons captured** (`lessons.md`, this burst): (a) `L-BB-D1152-pr-manager-runaway-subagent-spawning` — during PR #805, pr-manager spawned ~12 github-ops CI-watcher agents plus a parallel `fix-windows-path-assertion` test-writer that clobbered the coordinator's own implementer in the shared worktree, and the CI-watchers re-notified the orchestrator on every poll; going-forward discipline: bound CI-monitoring to a single watcher and enforce single-writer-per-worktree (never spawn a second fix-agent for a worktree an existing fix-agent already owns) — anchored E-12 (Engine Governance) for a follow-up story, no story ID allocated yet. (b) `L-BB-D1152-validate-factory-path-staging-cwd-false-positive` — `crates/hook-plugins/validate-factory-path-staging`'s branch-detection fallback (the no-explicit-target arm of `find_factory_class_target`, `src/lib.rs`) resolves the session's ORIGINAL cwd (main repo, `release/v1.0.0-rc.24`) rather than the Bash tool's actual per-call worktree cwd, producing a spurious `FactoryPathOnProductBranch` block on a glob `git add` issued from inside a feature worktree; anchored `crates/hook-plugins/validate-factory-path-staging` for a devops-engineer/architect fix (candidate: thread the Bash tool's `cwd` through `payload.extra`/`git_context`, precedent ADR-029, rather than falling back to the host process's own cwd). (c) macOS TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) EPERM read-block on `.factory/` files not created through a Full-Disk-Access-granted flow affected the orchestrator's direct reads this session — recorded as an environmental Drift Item (mitigation: grant the terminal/IDE Full Disk Access in System Settings), not a code defect. **Incidental, pre-existing, NOT caused by this burst:** `validate-table-cell-count` now fires on every write to `stories/STORY-INDEX.md` — the S-19.01 catalog row (line ~718) carries 13 pipe characters against the 10-pipe/9-column header, i.e. 3 unescaped literal `\|`-less pipes embedded somewhere in its narrative cell; confirmed via `git diff` that this burst's own edits (frontmatter block only) do not touch that line; recorded as a new Drift Item anchored to a maintenance-sweep/spec-steward pass. No ADR/BC-title/wire-format/security-model change beyond the POL-14 status flip itself (which IS the POLICY-14-mandated mechanical consequence of merge, not a new ratification) — POLICY 22 human-ratification NOT required. **S-25.01 convergence completely UNTOUCHED** (frozen `feature/S-25.01` code HEAD stays `3919ebcb`; BC-5.39.001 streak stays 0/3; NEXT remains fresh LOCAL adversary pass 16; no S-25.01 spec/BC/VP/story content read or touched by this burst).
