# Factory Health Check

Validate that the `.factory/` worktree is properly mounted and healthy. Auto-repair common issues.

## Checks (run in order)

### 1. Orphan branch exists

```bash
git branch --list factory-artifacts
```

- **If missing**: Create it.
  ```bash
  git checkout --orphan factory-artifacts
  git rm -rf --cached . 2>/dev/null || true
  git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: initialize factory-artifacts orphan branch"
  git checkout -  # return to previous branch
  ```

### 2. Worktree is mounted

```bash
git worktree list | grep -F '.factory'
```

- **If missing**: Mount it.

  First guard against a pre-existing **plain** `.factory/` directory. If
  `.factory` exists but is NOT a worktree (e.g. a bare `.factory/logs/` left by
  running `/onboard-observability` before this check), `git worktree add`
  fails on current git with `fatal: '.factory' already exists` when the
  directory is non-empty (verified on git 2.50/2.55; an empty one mounts
  cleanly). A nested mount at `.factory/.factory` — a corrupt layout — has
  also been observed once from this state (#205; mechanism unconfirmed —
  candidates are a nested add path during error recovery or a process
  re-creating `.factory` mid-setup).

  Note `rev-parse --git-dir` CANNOT detect the plain-dir case — for an
  in-repo plain directory it walks up, finds the parent repo's `.git`, and
  exits 0, exactly as it does for a real worktree. The guard therefore
  compares canonicalized (`pwd -P`, symlink-safe) worktree toplevels: a
  healthy mount's toplevel resolves to `<repo-root>/.factory`, a plain dir's
  resolves to the parent repo root. Run as one block — guard, prune stale
  registrations, mount, restore, assert:
  ```bash
  canon() { (cd "$1" 2>/dev/null && pwd -P); }    # symlink-safe path compare
  repo_root="$(canon "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")"

  # Nested corrupt layout (#205)? Positively confirmed only — route to the
  # recovery block below rather than mounting over it.
  if [ -e .factory/.factory/.git ]; then
    echo "ABORT: nested .factory/.factory mount detected — run the #205 recovery block" >&2
    exit 1
  fi

  # Plain-dir guard: move aside anything that is not a repo-root worktree.
  if [ -e .factory ] && \
     [ "$(canon "$(git -C .factory rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /nonexistent)")" != "$repo_root/.factory" ]; then
    mv .factory ".factory-backup-$(date +%s)"   # plain dir, not a root worktree
  fi

  git worktree prune   # drop stale registrations left by earlier bad recoveries
  git worktree add .factory factory-artifacts

  # Restore any backed-up contents (e.g. logs/) into the fresh worktree.
  for b in .factory-backup-*; do
    [ -e "$b" ] || continue
    cp -R "$b/." .factory/
    rm -rf "$b"
  done

  # Post-mount assertion — hard stop; later checks must not run on a bad mount.
  [ "$(canon "$(git -C .factory rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo /nonexistent)")" = "$repo_root/.factory" ] \
    || { echo "ABORT: .factory did not mount at the repo root" >&2; exit 1; }
  ```

  **#205 recovery block** — only for a positively confirmed nested mount
  (`.factory/.factory/.git` exists). Do NOT run
  `git worktree remove .factory --force` — that removal targets the wrong
  path and cannot fix a nested mount. And do not delete anything on a mere
  assertion failure: if the layout is not the known nested shape, inspect
  `git worktree list` manually instead. The wrapper directory is moved
  aside, not deleted, so its contents (e.g. logs/) are restored by the
  mount block's backup-restore step on re-run:
  ```bash
  if [ -e .factory/.factory/.git ]; then
    git worktree remove .factory/.factory --force
    mv .factory ".factory-backup-$(date +%s)"   # preserve wrapper contents
    git worktree prune                          # drop the dangling registration
    # Now re-run the mount block above; it mounts clean and restores the backup.
  else
    echo "ABORT: not the known nested shape — inspect 'git worktree list' manually" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
  ```

- **If mounted but pointing to wrong branch**: Remove and remount, then re-run
  the same post-mount assertion above.
  ```bash
  git worktree remove .factory --force
  git worktree add .factory factory-artifacts
  ```

### 3. Worktree is on correct branch

```bash
cd .factory && git branch --show-current
```

- Must be `factory-artifacts`. If not, the worktree is corrupt — remove and remount.

### 4. STATE.md exists

```bash
test -f .factory/STATE.md
```

- **If missing**: Create initial STATE.md. Derive `product` from the
  repository — use the repo directory name verbatim (do NOT strip any
  `-blue`/`-green` or other suffix; the name on disk is the name):
  ```bash
  git rev-parse --show-toplevel | xargs basename
  ```
  If that name is ambiguous or clearly not the product (e.g. a generic
  checkout dir), ask the human for the product name instead. Then write:
  ```yaml
  ---
  pipeline: INITIALIZED
  phase: pre-1
  product: <repo name from git, or human-supplied>
  mode: greenfield
  timestamp: <current ISO8601>
  ---
  ```

### 5. Directory structure intact

Verify these directories exist inside `.factory/`:

```
specs/ specs/behavioral-contracts/ specs/verification-properties/
specs/architecture/ specs/prd-supplements/ stories/ cycles/
holdout-scenarios/ holdout-scenarios/wave-scenarios/
holdout-scenarios/evaluations/ semport/ code-delivery/
demo-evidence/ dtu-clones/
```

- **If any missing**: Create them with `.gitkeep`.

### 6. Reference repos (conditional)

```bash
test -f .factory/reference-manifest.yaml
```

- **If manifest exists**: This project has brownfield-ingested repos. Verify `.reference/` is populated:
  - Parse the manifest and check that each listed repo has a corresponding directory in `.reference/`.
  - Report any missing repos with their clone URL so the user can rebuild.
  - Report count: `Reference repos: <N>/<total> present`
- **If no manifest**: Skip — this is a from-scratch project.

### 7. Factory lock status (BC-6.23.001 PC7 — shared helper)

Invoke the shared three-state lock status helper:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/factory-lock-status.sh .factory/STATE.md "$(git config user.email)"
```

Append the output line to the health report. The helper returns one of:
- `Factory lock: FREE` — no lock held or lock expired
- `Factory lock: HELD by this session (expires <expires_at>)` — self-held, unexpired
- `Factory lock: HELD by <holder_email> since <locked_at> (expires <expires_at>)` — foreign, unexpired
- `Factory lock: FREE (malformed block — treated as unlocked)` — parse failure, fail-open

This check reads the LOCAL STATE.md (no fetch required — local view is what matters for
informational display). Invokes the shared `factory-lock-status.sh` helper (AC-008
shared-helper mandate) so display cannot diverge from `/factory-worktree-health`.

### 8. Sync state

```bash
cd .factory && git status --porcelain
```

- **Clean**: All good.
- **Uncommitted changes**: Warn the user — there are uncommitted factory artifacts.
- **Diverged from remote**: Warn — manual resolution needed.

### 9. STATE.md health

Check STATE.md size and content routing compliance:

```bash
wc -l < .factory/STATE.md
```

- **≤ 200 lines**: Healthy.
- **201-500 lines**: Warn — recommend `/vsdd-factory:compact-state`.
- **501+ lines**: Error — STATE.md is bloated with historical content. Must compact before proceeding.

Also check for content that shouldn't be in STATE.md:
- Count `## Burst` or `## Pass` section headers — more than 10 means burst narratives are accumulating
- Count `## Session Resume Checkpoint` headers — more than 1 means old checkpoints aren't archived
- Count `adversary_pass_` frontmatter fields — more than 5 means per-pass tracking is in frontmatter

If any issues found, report them and recommend `/vsdd-factory:compact-state`.

## Output

Report a summary:

```
Factory Health: ✓ HEALTHY
  Branch:    factory-artifacts (orphan)
  Worktree:  .factory/ mounted
  STATE.md:  present (phase: <current phase>)
  State size: <N> lines (healthy | warning | bloated)
  Structure: all directories present
  Sync:      clean | uncommitted changes | diverged
```

Or if repairs were made:

```
Factory Health: REPAIRED
  Fixed: <list of what was repaired>
  Current state: <summary>
```
