  Pause the VSDD factory and make pipeline state durable so the session can be

  the session", or wants to pause the factory / end the session mid-pipeline
  without losing progress. Not for wrapping code or text (use standard
  bash/editor tools for that). Distinct from /compact-state (which slims
  STATE.md content, not the session) and /rehydrate-wave (which resumes after
  a cleared session).

# /vsdd-factory:wrap — Pause Factory & Checkpoint for Session Clear

Bring the running VSDD factory to a safe stop: halt new work, persist everything
in-flight to disk, mark the pipeline PAUSED, write a Session Resume Checkpoint,
release the factory lock, and print resume instructions. After this completes,
the session can be `/clear`ed (or closed) with zero loss — a fresh session
resumes from `.factory/STATE.md` alone.

**Invariant (INV-1):** All STATE.md writes go through the `vsdd-factory:state-manager`
agent (BC-6.23.001 Invariant 5 / BC-6.28.001 INV-1). This skill NEVER edits
STATE.md directly. If state-manager is unavailable at Step 4, the wrap fails with a
clear error; it does NOT fall back to direct STATE.md editing.

**Invariant (INV-2):** The `## Factory Wrapped` report and the `Safe to /clear`
declaration are NOT emitted until all Step 6 durability checks pass completely.
Reporting success ahead of verified durability is a behavioral violation identical
in severity to data loss.

**Invariant (INV-3):** No new pipeline sub-agents (orchestrator, implementer,
test-writer, holdout-evaluator, etc.) are spawned after Step 1. The state-manager
dispatch at Step 4 is the only agent delegation allowed post-halt; it is not a
"pipeline sub-agent" — it is the checkpoint-write mechanism. The factory-unlock
invocation at Step 5 is a skill call, not an agent dispatch, and is permitted.
**Exemption:** The Step 2 health-remediation skills `/vsdd-factory:compact-state`
and `/vsdd-factory:recover-state` are permitted to run as part of Step 2 triage —
they are not pipeline sub-agents barred by INV-3.

## Announce at Start

Before any other action, say verbatim:

> I'm using the wrap skill to pause the factory and make pipeline state durable for a session clear.

## Step 1 — Halt new work

- Do NOT spawn any new pipeline sub-agents from this point (INV-3).
- If sub-agents are currently running, let them finish their current atomic
  step (e.g., a micro-commit or a single test run) but record any that must be
  abandoned mid-step in the checkpoint notes at Step 4 (see PC-8 field (c)).

## Step 2 — Verify factory health

Run `/vsdd-factory:check-state-health`.

- **HEALTHY / WARNINGS:** proceed to Step 3.
- **NEEDS-COMPACT:** run `/vsdd-factory:compact-state` first so the checkpoint
  lands in a slim STATE.md. Verify all postconditions PC-1 through PC-16 against
  the compacted file.
- **STATE.md missing or corrupted:** run `/vsdd-factory:recover-state`, obtain
  human approval of the reconstruction, then continue. Step 7 is NOT emitted
  until PC-1 through PC-16 are satisfied on the reconstructed file.

## Step 3 — Persist uncommitted work

Nothing in-flight may live only in this conversation or in a dirty working tree.

1. **Product repo / story worktrees:** run `git status` in the main repo and any
   active `.worktrees/STORY-*` worktrees. For each with uncommitted changes,
   exactly one of the following two conditions MUST hold:
   - **(a) Committable WIP:** commit to the story's feature branch (NEVER to
     `main`, `develop`, or the default branch) with a message prefixed
     `wip(<STORY-ID>): session wrap checkpoint — <what is half-done>`, then
     push to remote if a remote is configured. Note: the `wip(<STORY-ID>):` prefix
     is the intentional checkpoint-commit convention (not a mistake).
   - **(b) Uncommittable state** (mid-red-gate, merge conflict, build failure):
     do NOT force a broken commit. Document the exact state explicitly in the
     Session Resume Checkpoint at Step 4 (PC-8 field (c)) instead. Step 7
     shows the worktree name and its un-committed status.
2. **Factory worktree:** run `git status` in `.factory/`. Any uncommitted
   artifact files (specs, stories, cycle files) are committed by state-manager
   at Step 4 along with STATE.md.
3. **Push story branches** to remote if one is configured (`git push` per
   branch). Three outcomes are possible:
   - **(a) Push succeeds:** note `pushed: yes` in the Step 7 report.
   - **(b) No remote configured:** note `pushed: no (no remote configured)` in
     the Step 7 report.
   - **(c) Push rejected** (network error or remote reject against an existing
     remote): note `pushed: no (push rejected — <reason>)` in the Step 7
     report. This is distinct from (b): a remote exists but the push failed.
     See Step 7 for the off-machine durability warning and acknowledgement gate.

## Step 4 — Pause + checkpoint via state-manager

**Before delegating:** Read `.factory/STATE.md` (use the Read tool — this is a
read-only operation) and record the current `version:` frontmatter value as
`pre_pause_version`. This value is needed for the PC-6 verification at Step 6.

Delegate to the `vsdd-factory:state-manager` agent (via the `Agent` tool) with
the following instruction set. The wrap skill makes ZERO direct Write or Edit
tool calls on STATE.md at this step or any other step (BC-6.28.001 INV-1;
PC-10). Wait for state-manager to report completion before proceeding to Step 5.

State-manager MUST perform ALL of the following in a single burst
(TD-VSDD-053 single-commit-per-burst):

1. Set `pipeline:` frontmatter to `PAUSED` (PC-1).
2. Refresh `timestamp:` to the pause instant ISO-8601 string (PC-2).
3. Update `phase:` to begin with `PAUSED <YYYY-MM-DD>.` and include the
   pipeline position string (PC-3).
4. Update `current_step:` per the verbatim-strict chain
   (D-441/D-442/D-443/D-444/D-449): `SESSION-WRAP-PAUSE-<YYYY-MM-DD>` step
   description; no meta-commentary, no clause-reordering, no
   justification-suffix injection (PC-4).
5. Update `last_amended:` with today's date, version bump token, `state-manager`
   identity, and a single-line pause description (PC-5).
6. Bump `version:` by exactly one point from the current value; no double-bump
   (PC-6; TD-VSDD-053).
7. Update the banner `wc-l` claim and dual-margin to match the actual
   `wc -l .factory/STATE.md` after the pause commit (PC-7; BC-5.39.005).
8. Archive the prior `## Session Resume Checkpoint` section to
   `cycles/<current_cycle>/session-checkpoints.md` (using the template at
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/session-checkpoints-template.md`) before
   writing the new one (content-routing discipline; PC-8 preamble).
9. Write exactly ONE new `## Session Resume Checkpoint` with all six minimum
   fields (PC-8):
   - (a) date and current pipeline position (phase, step, story/wave, what is next)
   - (b) convergence counter if in an adversarial/convergence loop (streak, pass count)
   - (c) in-flight work (stories mid-TDD, PRs awaiting review/CI, sub-agent steps
         abandoned at Step 1 above)
   - (d) pending human decisions and unresolved blockers raised this session
   - (e) WIP branch list with SHAs (or "none")
   - (f) the exact resume command
10. Append a Phase Progress / Current Phase Steps table row named
    `SESSION-WRAP-PAUSE-<YYYY-MM-DD>` with status `COMPLETE`, agent
    `state-manager`, and a one-line output description (PC-9).
11. Commit with subject prefix `factory(pause):` including the phase and
    one-line position string (single commit; TD-VSDD-053; PC-11).
12. Push to remote (`git push origin factory-artifacts`) if a remote is
    configured (PC-12). Three outcomes:
    - Push succeeds: report `pushed: yes`.
    - Push rejected (network error / remote reject): report
      `pushed: no (push rejected — <reason>)`.
    - No remote configured: report `pushed: no (no remote configured)`.
    In all cases the working-tree clean assertion (PC-12) still applies locally.

## Step 5 — Release the factory lock

If this session holds the cross-session factory lock, run
`/vsdd-factory:factory-unlock` so the resuming session (or another machine)
can acquire it (BC-6.23.001 PC4 `factory.lock.released` event; PC-14).

Skip silently if no lock is held and note `Lock: not held` in the Step 7 report
(EC-001). A lock that remains held at the time the Step 7 report is emitted is
a wrap failure.

## Step 6 — Verify durability

**Read-only verification only.** All checks in this step use only the Read tool,
`grep`, and `bash` (read-only commands such as `wc -l`, `git log`, `git status`).
Do NOT edit STATE.md or any other file at this step. On any failed check:
re-delegate the specific fix to `vsdd-factory:state-manager` (for STATE.md
failures), or re-run `/vsdd-factory:factory-unlock` (for PC-14 lock failures),
then re-run Step 6 from the beginning. Do NOT proceed to Step 7 while any check
is failing (INV-2; EC-007).

### PC-1 — `pipeline:` equals `PAUSED`

```bash
grep '^pipeline:' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: `pipeline: PAUSED`

### PC-2 — `timestamp:` refreshed to today's date

```bash
grep '^timestamp:' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: an ISO-8601 string containing today's date (YYYY-MM-DD).

### PC-3 — `phase:` begins with `PAUSED <YYYY-MM-DD>`

```bash
grep '^phase:' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: value begins with `PAUSED <YYYY-MM-DD>.` (today's date).

### PC-4 — `current_step:` contains `SESSION-WRAP-PAUSE-<YYYY-MM-DD>`

```bash
grep '^current_step:' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: value contains `SESSION-WRAP-PAUSE-<YYYY-MM-DD>`.

### PC-5 — `last_amended:` updated with today's date and `state-manager`

```bash
grep '^last_amended:' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: value begins with today's date (YYYY-MM-DD) and includes `state-manager`.

### PC-6 — `version:` bumped by exactly one from pre-pause value

```bash
grep '^version:' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: the numeric value equals `pre_pause_version + 1` (captured at the start
of Step 4). Confirm no double-bump (TD-VSDD-053).

### PC-7 — banner `wc-l` claim matches actual line count (HIGH — EC-007)

```bash
wc -l .factory/STATE.md
grep -E 'wc.l|margin from actual' .factory/STATE.md | head -5
```

Expected: the banner comment's claimed line count matches the actual `wc -l`
output. The dual-margin `500 - <actual> = <margin>` must be arithmetically
correct. A mismatch is HIGH severity (BC-5.39.005 banner seal discipline).

### PC-8 — exactly one `## Session Resume Checkpoint`, dated today

```bash
grep -c '## Session Resume Checkpoint' .factory/STATE.md
grep -A 2 '## Session Resume Checkpoint' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: count is exactly `1`; the checkpoint content includes today's date
(YYYY-MM-DD).

### PC-9 — Phase Progress row `SESSION-WRAP-PAUSE-<YYYY-MM-DD>` exists

```bash
grep 'SESSION-WRAP-PAUSE' .factory/STATE.md
```

Expected: at least one match; the row shows status `COMPLETE` and agent
`state-manager`.

### PC-10 — STATE.md mutations performed exclusively by state-manager

Satisfied structurally: this skill has made zero direct Write/Edit calls on
STATE.md at any step. No additional grep check required.

### PC-11 — exactly one `factory(pause):` commit; no `backfill`/`Stage N` chain

```bash
git -C .factory log --oneline -3
```

Expected: the most recent commit subject begins with `factory(pause):`. Neither
HEAD nor HEAD^ subject contains `backfill`, `Stage 1`, or `Stage 2`
(TD-VSDD-053).

### PC-12 — factory-artifacts working tree clean

```bash
git -C .factory status --porcelain
```

Expected: empty output (no staged, unstaged, or untracked files).

### PC-13 — product repo and story worktrees committed or documented

```bash
git status --porcelain
# For each active .worktrees/STORY-* directory:
# git -C .worktrees/<STORY-ID> status --porcelain
```

Expected for each: empty output (all changes committed) OR the exact
uncommittable state is explicitly documented in the Session Resume Checkpoint
PC-8 field (c).

### PC-14 — factory lock is FREE

```bash
grep '^factory_lock:' .factory/STATE.md && echo "LOCK HELD" || echo "LOCK FREE"
```

Expected: `LOCK FREE` — the `factory_lock:` key is absent from STATE.md
frontmatter (factory-unlock removed it at Step 5, or no lock was held).
If `LOCK HELD`: the lock is still present — wrap failure. Re-run
`/vsdd-factory:factory-unlock`, then re-verify. The `Lock:` line in Step 7 is
GATED on this verified state, not merely on Step 5 having run.

### PC-15 — resume guidance names `rehydrate-wave` before `next-step`

Verify structurally: the Step 7 report you are about to emit follows the template
order — `/vsdd-factory:rehydrate-wave` appears before `/vsdd-factory:next-step`.
A wrap report that lists only `next-step` without `rehydrate-wave` first is a
behavioral violation (BC-6.24.001).

---

Once all checks above pass, proceed to Step 7.

## Step 7 — Report

Only emit this report after Step 6 passes completely (INV-2).

**If the factory-artifacts checkpoint was NOT pushed to remote** (Step 4 item 12
or Step 3 item 3 reports `pushed: no` for either reason — no remote configured
OR push rejected), you MUST perform the following before emitting the full report:

1. Emit the warning line:
   `⚠ Off-machine durability NOT guaranteed — checkpoint is local-only.`
2. Ask the operator explicitly:
   `The factory checkpoint exists only on this machine. If this machine is lost
   before a push succeeds, the checkpoint will be unrecoverable. Type "acknowledge"
   to confirm local-only mode and proceed.`
3. Wait for the operator to type `acknowledge` (or equivalent explicit
   confirmation).
4. Only after acknowledgement, emit the full "Factory Wrapped" report below,
   including `Safe to /clear or close this session.`

Do NOT emit `Safe to /clear or close this session.` on an un-pushed checkpoint
without explicit operator acknowledgement (BC-6.28.001 EC-006 / INV-2).

```
## Factory Wrapped

Pipeline: PAUSED at <phase> / <current_step>
Checkpoint: .factory/STATE.md (committed <sha>, pushed: yes)
WIP commits: <branch>@<sha>, ... (or: none)
Lock: released (or: not held)

Safe to /clear or close this session.

To resume: open a new session in this project and run
  /vsdd-factory:rehydrate-wave
then
  /vsdd-factory:next-step
Both steps are required. rehydrate-wave injects the correct wave scope;
next-step routes work from the checkpoint.
```

Report notes:
- `<phase>` and `<current_step>` are quoted verbatim from the updated STATE.md
  frontmatter fields (PC-16a).
- `committed <sha>` is the factory-artifacts commit SHA from Step 4 (PC-16b).
- `pushed: yes` or `pushed: no (<reason>)` per actual push outcome (PC-16b).
  When `pushed: no`, the `⚠ Off-machine durability NOT guaranteed` warning line
  MUST appear and operator acknowledgement is required before `Safe to /clear`.
- `WIP commits:` lists `<branch>@<sha>` for every branch committed at Step 3,
  or `none` if no WIP was in-flight (PC-16c).
- `Lock:` is `released` if factory-unlock ran at Step 5, or `not held` if
  Step 5 was skipped silently (PC-16d). This value is VERIFIED by the PC-14
  grep check in Step 6 — not merely assumed from Step 5 having run.
- `Safe to /clear or close this session.` is the exact wording (PC-16e) — this
  is the human-facing signal that all postconditions have been verified.

## Out of scope

- Does NOT complete or merge in-flight stories — it checkpoints them.
- Does NOT modify spec or story content.
- Does NOT run compaction unless STATE.md health requires it (Step 2 routing).
- Does NOT wrap code or text (use standard bash/editor tools for that).
