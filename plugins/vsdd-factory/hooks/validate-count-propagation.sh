# validate-count-propagation.sh — PostToolUse lint hook for cross-document count drift
#
# Triggered: PostToolUse Write/Edit on ARCH-INDEX.md, BC-INDEX.md, VP-INDEX.md,
#            STATE.md, STORY-INDEX.md, PRD.md, or SS-NN-*.md architecture files.
#
# Behavior:
#   1. Extract count-bearing patterns from the modified file using anchored regexes.
#   2. Grep corpus index files for the same count-keyword pairs.
#   3. If the same keyword appears in a sibling document at a DIFFERENT numeric value,
#      emit a structured warning to stderr and exit 2.
#   4. Exit 0 on no drift OR if count is absent from a sibling file (absence != drift).
#
# Scope limit: reports drift, does not modify files, does not interpret semantics.
# Performance: O(n) two-pass pre-processing (awk length filter + sed ID-strip) before
# the per-line loop; <1s on real corpus files including BC-INDEX.md with 2595 lines
# and a single ~195KB last_amended: blob (S-25.01 CPU-runaway fix).
#
# S-7.02 / BC-7.05.001, BC-7.05.002

# of these ("Lists all 36 BCs" in a changelog entry, "PRD (38 BCs)" in a Phase
# Progress row) is an immutable record and MUST be allowed to disagree with the
# current count — comparing it as drift is the #567 false positive. Boundaries
# use the same "^## opens, next ^## closes" idiom as
# validate-changelog-monotonicity.sh.
#
# "## Drift Items" is included as defence-in-depth consistent with the historical
# heading convention: if a drift-items section ever appears earlier in a file than
# the authoritative live count, table cells in that section (e.g., stale snapshots
# of BCs/VPs counts at the time the item was recorded) must not shadow the live
# count. This does not change the verdict for any file in the current corpus —
# all live authoritative counts appear outside drift-items sections today.

# Extract count-bearing pairs from a file.
# Outputs lines of format: KEYWORD:COUNT:RANK
#   RANK 0 — authoritative (YAML frontmatter keys like total_bcs:, total_vps:)

# Rank-precedence is forward-looking hardening: if a corpus file ever has a
# rank-0 frontmatter key that appears after a rank-1 prose mention in file
# order, the rank-0 value still wins. No current corpus file exercises this
# today — VP-INDEX.md and BC-INDEX.md have total_vps: / total_bcs: frontmatter
# keys (rank-0) but they appear before any prose count mentions in file order,
# so rank precedence is not decisive in practice. STATE.md has no total_vps:
# or total_bcs: frontmatter keys at all.
#
# Supported patterns:
#   "NNN BCs" / "NNN,NNN BCs" — count before keyword (rank 1)
#   "BCs | NNN" / "BCs: NNN" — keyword before count (table or YAML) (rank 1)
#   "total_bcs: NNN" / "total_vps: NNN" — YAML frontmatter keys (rank 0)
# Count mentions inside historical H2 sections (see _is_historical_heading) are
# skipped so frozen records are never compared against the current count (#567).

  # Pre-process the file in two O(n) passes BEFORE the per-line loop so no
  # per-line operation ever sees a mega-line or a raw ID token:
  #
  #   Pass 1 — awk length filter: drop lines > 8192 chars.
  #     A legitimate count keyword ("42 BCs", "total_bcs: 42") is typically a
  #     short token. Additionally, lines > 8192 chars are frozen historical
  #     changelog records (e.g., last_amended: blobs) whose embedded counts are
  #     stale and must not shadow real totals — the explicit frontmatter skip
  #     below handles the named fields, but the length guard provides
  #     defence-in-depth for any other oversized record.
  #     Skipping (not truncating) avoids token-split artefacts: a
  #     mid-ID truncation could produce a phantom digit sequence.
  #     Semantic delta: pre-fix, the hook hung on >8192-char lines and never
  #     emitted a verdict; post-fix, it completes. The length filter removes
  #     oversized lines (typically frozen changelog blobs) from extraction
  #     scope, so stale counts embedded in those blobs no longer shadow
  #     authoritative frontmatter values. This is an intentional improvement,
  #     not a no-op.
  #     S-25.01 / fix/count-propagation-cpu-runaway.
  #
  #   Pass 2 — sed -E ID-strip: remove <letters>-<digits-and-dots> tokens
  #     (BC-1.18.003, VP-105, E-11, S-3, TD-001) so their embedded digits are
  #     not parsed as quantities (#690).  sed -E uses a provably-linear NFA;
  #     no backtracking is possible.  `sed -E` is portable to BSD sed (macOS)
  #     and GNU sed (Linux).
  #
  #     Contrast with the prior extglob form "${line//+([A-Za-z])-+([0-9.])/}":
  #     that form ran per-line inside the loop. On a single ~195KB line, bash's
  #     global-replace did O(n*k) string copies (n = line length,
  #     k = match count ≈ 8000), spinning a full core for >12s in PostToolUse
  #     and orphaning the process at PPID 1.
  #     A single whole-file sed pass has O(1) spawn cost and O(n) scan cost.
  #
  #   Error propagation: a process substitution `done < <(awk | sed)` silently
  #     discards awk/sed failures under set -e (the pipe runs in a subshell,
  #     so set -e does not propagate to the parent loop). Explicit temp file +
  #     || error path guarantees the pipeline failure is detected and the
  #     function returns 1 rather than silently producing zero counts
  #     (false-pass: "no drift found").
  #
  #   Heading lines (## …) are inspected AFTER both passes; canonical heading
  #   names used by _is_historical_heading contain no ID tokens, so the strip
  #   does not affect historical-section boundary detection.
