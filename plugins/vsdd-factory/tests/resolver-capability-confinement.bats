# resolver-capability-confinement.bats — VP-076 capability confinement integration tests.
#
# Verifies that the dispatcher's path_allow enforcement prevents resolvers from
# reading files outside the declared capability sandbox. Specifically:
#
#   VP-076-A: capability denial IS enforced (naughty resolver cannot read /etc/passwd)
#   VP-076-B: no sensitive data leaks through a denied read
#   VP-076-C: resolver.capability_denied event appears in VSDD_SINK_FILE
#   VP-076-D: reads within path_allow succeed (positive capability test)
#
# Strategy chosen: Option B (F-P3-002 fix-burst decision).
#   The Rust unit stubs in capability_confinement_test.rs remain as #[ignore]'d stubs
#   with redirect comments pointing here. Real verification is in this bats file.
#   Rationale: vsdd-context-resolvers crate has zero compile-time dep on factory-dispatcher
#   (BC-1.13.001 INV1 / ADR-018); testing at the bats level exercises the full pipeline.
#
# Fixtures:
#   crates/factory-dispatcher/tests/fixtures/naughty_resolver.{wat,wasm}
#   plugins/vsdd-factory/hook-plugins/naughty-resolver.wasm (copy of above for PLUGIN_ROOT lookup)
#
# BC traces:
#   BC-4.12.003 INV1 — resolver cannot access filesystem without path_allow grant
#   BC-4.12.003 INV2 — resolvers MUST use vsdd::read_file for all I/O (no WASI preopens)
#   BC-4.12.004 INV1 — no panic / no crash on resolver errors
