# stamp-state-timestamp.bats — S-17.05 bats integration tests (BC-5.38.001 Red Gate).
#
# Covers the 4 bats integration cases from S-17.05 v1.3 Red Gate Test Table:
#
#   AC-006 (e2e): PostToolUse Write, foreign holder present →
#                 expires_at MUST remain byte-identical (identity mismatch → no renewal).
#                 Requires dispatcher + WASM → skip if absent. Red Gate: WASM absent or
#                 stub-renewing unconditionally → expires_at changed assertion fails.
#
#   AC-011 (registry shape): hooks-registry.toml entry for stamp-state-timestamp
#                 MUST NOT include "Bash" or "Agent" in the tool matcher.
#                 Registry absent → fails immediately (no WASM required).
#
#   AC-013 (registry atomicity): stamp-state-timestamp entry PRESENT AND
#                 verify-state-timestamp-refresh entry ABSENT in the same commit.
#                 ADR-046 Decision 3 atomicity constraint.
#                 Either condition unmet → fails immediately (no WASM required).
#
#   AC-014 (e2e mid-burst): PostToolUse Write, self-holder present →
#                 expires_at IS renewed (identity match → renewal fires).
#                 Mandatory real-WASM test per the S-17.04 AC-018 lesson.
#                 Requires dispatcher + WASM → skip if absent.
#
# Story: S-17.05 v1.3 (stamp-state-timestamp PostToolUse WASM hook)
# BC: BC-4.17.001 (stamp-state-timestamp), BC-5.40.001 PC4 (mid-burst keep-alive)
# ADR: ADR-046 (PostToolUse stamp), ADR-019 (async=false)
#
# KEY BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCE FROM PRETOOLUSE GUARDS:
#   This hook is PostToolUse — the write has ALREADY happened when the hook fires.
#   The hook reads the ON-DISK, post-write file and re-stamps it.
#   There is NO old_string/new_string/content reconstruction step (unlike the retired
#   verify-state-timestamp-refresh guard). The bats tests write the fixture STATE.md
#   first (simulating the agent's already-completed write), then invoke the dispatcher
#   with a PostToolUse payload, then read back STATE.md to assert the hook's output.
#
# File location: plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/stamp-state-timestamp.bats
# (flat path — discovered by run-all.sh `tests/*.bats` glob).
#
# Exit codes (dispatcher stdout/stderr, not hook-specific):
#   0 = Continue (hook ran; PostToolUse hooks cannot block)
#   1 = Error (dispatcher/plugin failure)
#
# Run:
#   bats plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/stamp-state-timestamp.bats

  # Hermetic git identity (CI env-independence fix, PR #798).
  #
  # The hook's exec_subprocess capability shells out to `git config user.email`
  # to resolve the writer identity for lock-renewal decisions (BC-4.17.001 PC2).
  # On CI runners with no ambient git identity, this returns empty, causing
  # IdentityResolutionFailed — the self-lock renewal test (AC-014) then fails
  # because the hook cannot confirm a match.
  #
  # Fix: create a throwaway gitconfig in $WORK and export GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL +
  # GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM + HOME so that (a) _write_state_self_lock captures the
  # same identity as (b) the hook subprocess receives via env_allow.
  #
  # The hook registry declares env_allow = ["HOME", "GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL",
  # "XDG_CONFIG_HOME"], so both HOME and GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL propagate into
  # the WASM sandbox's git subprocess automatically.
  #
  # SAFETY: the foreign-lock fixture (AC-006) hardcodes holder@example.com,
  # which will never match ci-hermetic@vsdd-factory.test — that test's
  # no-renewal assertion remains intact.
