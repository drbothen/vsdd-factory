# sprint-state-format.bats — Red Gate tests for S-18.11 sprint-state.yaml per-story format
#
# Story:   S-18.11 — sprint-state.yaml producer migration to per-story {id, status} format
# BCs:     BC-5.41.004 (producer: stories: key, per-entry schema, two-partition ordering,
#                        completeness, 8-value enum INV-1, no-fabrication INV-2,
#                        no-phantom-wave INV-3, EC-007 UnknownStatusToken,
#                        EC-010 TopoViolation-tolerate-supersession-edge)
#          BC-5.41.001 (consumer: PC2 wave_id wave-group-ordinal algorithm
#                        (derive_wave_id: completed terminal wave groups + 1);
#                        P-SPRINT-STATE-WAVE-ORDER precondition)
#          BC-5.41.002 (consumer: PC3 stories from sprint-state.yaml status:draft/pending;
#                        reserved-pending no-op annotation; BrokenSprintState handling)
#
# GREEN-TRANSITION COMPLETE (post-T-4 + T-5): All fixture-based tests now use
# conformant fixtures (fixture-migrated.yaml / fixture-leading-run.yaml).
# The legacy RED gate assertions have been replaced with GREEN assertions.
# Test 6 (epics-coexistence regression) locks the PC5-coexistence awk-anchor fix.
#
# POST-T-6 ADDITIONS (F-P1-004 / F-P1-007):
# Tests 7-11 close the false-green coverage gap (F-P1-004) by exercising the REAL
# production sprint-state.yaml against the REAL consumer derive_wave_id (T-7), and
# add architect-specified regression guards (T-8..T-11) using fixtures so they run in CI.
# T-12 (awk harmonize) is structural: no new test but all exit-pattern regexes are
# harmonized to /^[^[:space:]#]/ (F-P1-007).
#
# CI-PORTABILITY DESIGN (cross-tree / CI-portability constraint):
# ---------------------------------------------------------------
# The production sprint-state.yaml lives at .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml on
# the factory-artifacts orphan branch, mounted as a git worktree at .factory/ in
# local development. In a fresh CI checkout of the feature branch (or develop),
# .factory/ is NOT present — it is a separate orphan-branch worktree that is only
# mounted locally (see CLAUDE.md §Git Workflow factory-artifacts branch).
#
# Pattern used by sibling tests (wave-handoff.bats test_BC_5_41_001_PC10_S18_13_AC002*
# and multiple tests in rehydrate-wave.bats): skip with `skip "<reason>"` when a
# production file is absent, so the test is SKIPPED (not FAILED) in CI.
# Fixture-based tests are CI-portable because they use files committed in
# plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/fixtures/sprint-state-format/ on the feature branch.
#
# Test classification:
#   PRODUCTION-FILE + .factory-GUARDED SKIP:
#     test_sprint_state_stories_list_present                (T-1, AC-001)
#       → SKIP when .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml absent (CI);
#         GREEN when .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml has conformant per-story format.
#   FIXTURE-BASED (CI-portable, GREEN post-T-4):
#     test_sprint_state_stories_wave_order                  (T-2, AC-002) — fixture-migrated.yaml
#     test_sprint_state_status_matches_story_index          (T-3, AC-003) — fixture-migrated.yaml + fixture-STORY-INDEX.md

#     test_wave_id_wave_group_ordinal                       (T-5, AC-006) — fixture-leading-run.yaml
#       → obs-1b fix: tests PRODUCTION derive_wave_id (wave_id=2); NOT the test-local
#         _leading_terminal_run helper (which returned 11 via wrong raw-count semantics).
#     test_epics_coexistence_nested_stories_ignored         (T-6, PC5/EC-004) — fixture-migrated.yaml
#   PRODUCTION-FILE + .factory-GUARDED SKIP (F-P1-004 real-file round-trip):
#     test_real_production_file_round_trip                  (T-7, F-P1-004) — .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml
#       → SKIP when .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml absent (CI);
#         GREEN when derive_wave_id exits 0 and returns positive integer.
#   FIXTURE-BASED REGRESSION GUARDS (CI-portable, architect-specified):
#     test_consumer_accepts_partial_status                  (T-8)  — fixture-partial-accepted.yaml
#     test_consumer_rejects_interleaved_ordering            (T-9)  — fixture-interleaved-order.yaml

#     test_consumer_rejects_complete_status                 (T-11) — fixture-complete-status.yaml
#   PRODUCTION-FILE + .factory-GUARDED SKIP (obs-2 real-file completeness + status-fidelity):
#     test_real_production_file_completeness_and_status_fidelity (T-12, PC4+PC2/INV-2) — .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml
#       → SKIP when .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml or .factory/stories/STORY-INDEX.md absent (CI);
#         GREEN when all sprint-state IDs match non-retired STORY-INDEX IDs (PC4 completeness)
#         AND each story's status matches its STORY-INDEX catalog row (PC2/INV-2 status-fidelity).
#   PRODUCTION-FILE + .factory-GUARDED SKIP (EC-010 supersession-edge tolerate path):
#     test_supersession_edge_tolerated_partition_placement (T-13, BC-5.41.004 EC-010)
#       → SKIP when .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml absent (CI);
#         GREEN when: migration was emitted (file exists and is well-formed);
#           S-3.04 (partial, superseded_by: ADR-015) is in the NON-TERMINAL partition;
#           S-3.01/S-3.02/S-3.03/S-4.07/S-4.08 (merged dependents) are in the TERMINAL prefix.
#         Locks in EC-010 TOLERATE behavior: supersession-edge did NOT trigger TopoViolation abort.
#   PRODUCTION-FILE + .factory-GUARDED SKIP (def-b full-graph depth intra-partition ordering):
#     test_partitions_sorted_by_full_graph_depth_def_b (T-14, BC-5.41.004 PC3 / ADR-026 §Decision 3a)
#       → SKIP when .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml or .factory/stories/STORY-INDEX.md absent (CI);
#         GREEN when BOTH partitions monotonically satisfy: depth[i] <= depth[i+1]; lex[i] <= lex[i+1]
#           when depths equal; with NO terminal entry after the first non-terminal entry.
#         Independently computes full-graph wave-depth from STORY-INDEX.md depends_on edges
#         (iterative longest-path with epic-expansion for "E-8"/"E-9" text refs);
#         does NOT trust the producer's output for depth values.
#
# EC-010 ABORT-PATH NOTE (no bats test — correct by design):
#   The EC-010 hard-abort path (terminal story depends_on a non-terminal NON-superseded story)
#   is enforced by the wave-scheduling SKILL.md Step 5 TopoViolation guard, which is an LLM-
#   executed producer-side check. There is no executable producer script to invoke in bats.
#   Furthermore, the real graph contains NO genuine-anomaly instance — every terminal→non-terminal
#   dependency edge is the S-3.04 supersession edge (tolerated by EC-010). A bats test that
#   re-implements the guard logic would be a tautology (testing our test, not the production guard).
#   The abort path is verified by: (a) BC-5.41.004 §Canonical Test Vectors rows
#   topo-violation-genuine-anomaly + topo-violation-supersession-tolerated; (b) SKILL.md Step 5
#   TopoViolation guard prose. The TOLERATE path is verified on real data by T-13 below.
#
# AWK ANCHOR FIX (PC5 coexistence) + F-P1-007 HARMONIZATION:
# All awk patterns that enter `in_stories=1` use /^stories:/ (column-0 anchor),
# NOT /^[[:space:]]*stories:/. This prevents nested epics[*].stories: sub-keys
# from re-entering the stories: parsing context and emitting out-of-enum values.
# fixture-migrated.yaml has epics.E-0.stories=closed + epics.E-1.stories=tier-1-shipped
# which are out-of-enum scalars that MUST be ignored by all awk parsers.
#
# F-P1-007 — ALL block-exit patterns harmonized to ONE canonical form:
#   in_stories && /^[^[:space:]#]/ { in_stories=0 }
# This replaces the three prior variants:
#   (a) /^[^[:space:]#-]/                  (was: _count_stories_per_story_entries)
#   (b) /^[^[:space:]#-]/ && !/^[[:space:]]/ (was: all other inline awk blocks — redundant)
#   (c) /^[^[:space:]]/ { result=1; exit } (was: _stories_is_sequence)
# The canonical form /^[^[:space:]#]/ means "column-0 non-space, non-comment" —
# identical intent to form (b) but without the redundant double-negation, and
# without the spurious `-` exclusion that was harmless but inconsistent.
#
# PORTABILITY RULES (Architecture Compliance Rules §3-§7):
#   §3 set -euo pipefail in all helper scriptlets
#   §4 POSIX character classes: [[:space:]] not \s, [[:digit:]] not \d
#   §5 No local -A (bash 3.2 guard): use plain variables or indexed arrays
#   §6 No global IFS mutation: any IFS assignment is scoped via subshell or local
#   §7 No undeclared python/PyYAML: prefer awk/grep for YAML key extraction;
#      yq is available in CI (see ci.yml line 31/547/548)
#
# TOOL AVAILABILITY in CI (ci.yml verified):
#   bats-core, jq, yq, bash (4+ on Linux; 3.2 on macOS but brew bash 5 in PATH),
#   awk, grep -E, sort, git
#   No jq used in this suite (POSIX awk/grep sufficient for YAML key extraction)

# Live-artifact CI guard (issue #724)
#
# The five live-production-file tests below were designed per the PORTABILITY
# notes above to SKIP in CI and run locally — the original guard keyed on the
# .factory/ mount being absent, which was true in CI when they were authored.
# CI now mounts factory-artifacts, which re-enabled these tests in CI runs.
# In a pull_request run, CI mounts the BASE repo's artifact branch — a PR can
# never modify what these tests assert — so any base-side artifact drift fails
# every unrelated PR with the failure attributed to the PR (issue #724 is the
# concrete instance: a PC3 def-b ordering violation in sprint-state.yaml failed
# ten unrelated PRs at once).
#
# This guard restores the documented local-only design explicitly: skip under
# GitHub Actions, keep full enforcement in local runs (and in the factory's
# own hooks). If push-run enforcement is wanted, narrow the condition to
# [ "${GITHUB_EVENT_NAME:-}" = "pull_request" ].

# T-14 / BC-5.41.004 PC3 / ADR-026 §Decision 3a
#
# Definition (b) full-graph wave-depth ordering:
#   depth(S) = 1 if depends_on empty
#            = 1 + max(depth(P) for P in S.depends_on)  over the FULL depends_on graph
#              (ALL edges, all statuses including supersession edges)
#
# Within each partition, consecutive pairs (i, i+1) must satisfy:
#   depth[i] <= depth[i+1]
#   if depth[i] == depth[i+1]: id[i] <= id[i+1]  (lexicographic tie-break)
#
# Partition A (terminal prefix): stories with status merged/withdrawn/cancelled,
#   forming a contiguous leading block.
# Partition B (non-terminal): the remaining stories.
# No terminal entry may appear after the first non-terminal entry.
#
# INDEPENDENT DEPTH COMPUTATION:
#   This test reads STORY-INDEX.md depends_on edges (col 7) and computes depth
#   via iterative longest-path relaxation (up to 30 passes). It does NOT trust
#   the producer's ordering as a proxy for depth — that would be a tautology.
#
#   Epic-level dep references ("E-8", "E-9", "E-9 W-16 closure") are expanded to
#   the concrete non-retired story IDs from those epics:
#     E-8 → S-8.00..S-8.09 S-8.10 S-8.30  (non-retired E-8 stories per STORY-INDEX)
#     E-9 → S-9.00..S-9.07                  (non-retired E-9 stories per STORY-INDEX)
#   Range patterns (S-N.A..S-N.B) are expanded to individual zero-padded IDs.
#   Withdrawn stories in sprint-state but without a STORY-INDEX entry (e.g. S-9.30)
#   are assigned depth=1 (no tracked dependencies).
#
# PORTABILITY: guarded to SKIP when .factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml or
#   .factory/stories/STORY-INDEX.md absent (CI without factory-artifacts worktree).
#   Runs locally where the factory-artifacts worktree is mounted.
#
# Spot anchors (informational, not load-bearing assertions):
#   S-9.00 (dep=E-8, depth=5) appears after all depth<=4 terminal stories.
#   S-3.01 (dep=S-2.08+S-3.04, depth=10) appears after S-3.04 (depth=4) and
#     after S-2.08 (depth=9).
#   S-4.08 (dep=S-4.07+..., depth=12) appears after S-4.07 (depth=11).
#
