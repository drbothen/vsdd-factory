# Behavioral Contract BC-7.04.021: validate-index-self-reference: warns when index lacks current pass/burst row

## Description

validate-index-self-reference: warns when index lacks current pass/burst row. No emit-event call (notable: only validator without _emit). Always exit 0.

**Source category:** Validator hook scripts (validate-* and verify-*).
**Audit ID:** `BC-AUDIT-1112` (extracted from `pass-3-deep-hooks.md` line 1249).
**Hook script:** ``plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/validate-index-self-reference.sh``.

## Preconditions

1. Trigger: file_path matches `.factory/cycles/*/INDEX.md` or `…/burst-log.md`. Reads STATE.md for `current_step:`. Extracts pass/burst numbers via regex. If file does not contain a reference to the current pass-N or burst-N → stderr WARN (advisory only).

## Postconditions

1. Behavior: No emit-event call (notable: only validator without _emit). Always exit 0.
2. Exit codes: 0.

## Invariants

1. Hook script identity (script path) and registry binding remain stable across the contract lifetime.
2. Exit-code semantics conform to the dispatcher contract: 0 = allow / advisory, 2 = block, 1 = jq-missing-fail-closed (where applicable).

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | TBD | TBD |

## Canonical Test Vectors

> Golden-file test inputs and expected outputs. Used for regression testing and agent validation.

| Input | Expected Output | Category |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| Acceptance criterion (see below) | STATE.md current_step `pass-72` + INDEX.md without "pass-72" reference → stderr WARN. | happy-path |
| TBD edge-case | TBD | edge-case |
| TBD error-case | TBD | error |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| VP-TBD | TBD — to be assigned during VP synthesis | manual |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | TBD |
| L2 Domain Invariants | TBD |
| Architecture Module | SS-07 (Hook Bash Layer) |
| Stories | TBD (filled by story-writer) |

## Related BCs (Recommended)

- TBD — to be cross-linked during BC graph synthesis.

## Architecture Anchors (Recommended)

- `architecture/ss-07-hook-bash.md` — anchor TBD.

## Story Anchor (Recommended)

TBD — story will be assigned during story-writer phase.

## VP Anchors (Recommended)

- TBD — VP linkage to be added during VP synthesis.

### Brownfield-Specific Sections

#### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | ``plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/validate-index-self-reference.sh`` |
| **Confidence** | high |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |
| **Source Document** | `pass-3-deep-hooks.md` line 1249 |
| **Audit ID** | `BC-AUDIT-1112` |
| **Source Line(s) (within hook)** | 28-87. |

#### Evidence Types Used

- **guard clause**: explicit validation check in the hook script body (regex / substring / glob match).

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **I/O operations** | reads + writes (stdin JSON, stderr diagnostics, optional event emission via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/emit-event`) |
| **Global state access** | reads global (env vars: `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, optionally `VSDD_*`) |
| **Deterministic** | yes — bash hooks are deterministic given identical stdin envelope and filesystem state |
| **Thread safety** | not applicable (subprocess-isolated invocation per hook fire) |
| **Overall classification** | effectful shell |

#### Refactoring Notes

Bash hook scripts are inherently effectful (stdin/stderr, optional event emit, optional state-file reads). Native (Rust) replacement would extract pure parse/decision logic from the I/O shell, exposing a `fn(payload) -> HookResult` contract per BC-7.02.009. Until that port lands, the contract is preserved by the script body verbatim and the registry binding tuple.
