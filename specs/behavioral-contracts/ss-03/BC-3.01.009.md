# Behavioral Contract BC-3.01.009: otel-grpc sink loads with unreachable endpoint (lazy connect)

> Section: Sink registry and base contracts
> Source BC (audit ID): BC-AUDIT-049

## Description

Registry construction succeeds; worker connects lazily.

## Preconditions

1. observability-config.toml `endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:1"` (will fail).

## Postconditions

1. Registry construction succeeds; worker connects lazily.

## Invariants

1. TBD — invariants not explicitly stated in source pass-3 entry.

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | TBD — Phase 1.6b will enumerate edge cases from source review | TBD |

## Canonical Test Vectors

> Test vectors will be pulled from the pinned test case in Phase 1.6b.

| Input | Expected Output | Category |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| TBD | TBD | happy-path |
| TBD | TBD | edge-case |
| TBD | TBD | error |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| (TBD — to be assigned in Phase 1.6c) | TBD — Phase 1.6b will identify formal verification properties | manual |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | TBD (subsystem L2 spec pending) |
| L2 Domain Invariants | TBD |
| Architecture Module | SS-03 (Sink registry and base contracts) |
| Stories | TBD (Phase 2 story-writer pass) |

## Related BCs (Recommended)

- TBD — cross-references will be filled in Phase 1.6b after all per-BC files exist.

## Architecture Anchors (Recommended)

- `architecture/SS-03-observability-sinks.md` — section: Sink registry and base contracts

### Brownfield-Specific Sections

> This BC was extracted during Phase 0d brownfield ingestion (BC-AUDIT pass) and migrated to canonical one-per-file BC-S.SS.NNN format in Phase 1.4b.

#### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/sinks/mod.rs` |
| **Source line(s)** | TBD |
| **Confidence** | high |
| **Original audit ID** | BC-AUDIT-049 |
| **Pass-3 source** | `pass-3-behavioral-contracts.md:328` |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |

**Evidence (from pass-3):**

> `sinks/mod.rs::tests::load_builds_otel_grpc_sink_from_parsed_config`.

#### Evidence Types Used

- **inferred**: from pass-3 narrative; no explicit assertion captured

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **I/O operations** | TBD — Phase 1.6b will classify |
| **Global state access** | TBD |
| **Deterministic** | TBD |
| **Thread safety** | TBD |
| **Overall classification** | TBD |

#### Refactoring Notes

TBD — Phase 1.6b will produce refactoring guidance.
