# Behavioral Contract BC-3.03.001: Batch trigger thresholds are independent — `size` (default 100) AND `interval_ms` (default 5000

> Section: OTLP gRPC sink batching and lifecycle
> Source BC (audit ID): BC-AUDIT-137

## Description

Two independent triggers:

## Preconditions

1. Worker accumulates events.

## Postconditions

1. Two independent triggers:

## Invariants

1. TBD — invariants not explicitly stated in source pass-3 entry.

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | TBD — Phase 1.6b will enumerate edge cases from source review | TBD |

## Canonical Test Vectors

> Test vectors will be pulled from the pinned test case in Phase 1.6b.

| Input | Expected Output | Category |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| TBD | TBD | happy-path |
| TBD | TBD | edge-case |
| TBD | TBD | error |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| VP-001 | TBD — Phase 1.6b will identify formal verification properties | manual |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | TBD (subsystem L2 spec pending) |
| L2 Domain Invariants | TBD |
| Architecture Module | SS-03 (OTLP gRPC sink batching and lifecycle) |
| Stories | TBD (Phase 2 story-writer pass) |

## Related BCs (Recommended)

- TBD — cross-references will be filled in Phase 1.6b after all per-BC files exist.

## Architecture Anchors (Recommended)

- `architecture/SS-03-observability-sinks.md` — section: OTLP gRPC sink batching and lifecycle

### Brownfield-Specific Sections

> This BC was extracted during Phase 0d brownfield ingestion (BC-AUDIT pass) and migrated to canonical one-per-file BC-S.SS.NNN format in Phase 1.4b.

#### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/lib.rs` |
| **Source line(s)** | TBD |
| **Confidence** | high |
| **Original audit ID** | BC-AUDIT-137 |
| **Pass-3 source** | `pass-3-behavioral-contracts-deep-r1.md:489` |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |

**Evidence (from pass-3):**

> `sink-otel-grpc/src/lib.rs:486-549` (worker_loop with `tokio::select! { msg = recv_fut => …, _ = sleep_until(deadline) => flush_buffer; continue }`); `:519-534` (size-trigger after push). DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE = 100 / DEFAULT_BATCH_INTERVAL_MS = 5000 declared at `:78-83`.

#### Evidence Types Used

- **inferred**: from pass-3 narrative; no explicit assertion captured

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **I/O operations** | TBD — Phase 1.6b will classify |
| **Global state access** | TBD |
| **Deterministic** | TBD |
| **Thread safety** | TBD |
| **Overall classification** | TBD |

#### Refactoring Notes

TBD — Phase 1.6b will produce refactoring guidance.
