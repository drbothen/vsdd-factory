# BC-1.18.011: Governed One-Time Migration for the B2 BC-INDEX Body Split (Content-Preservation, Independent Census, Crash-Atomicity, Rollback)

## Description

BC-1.18.010 specifies mechanism B2's END-STATE (per-subsystem shard files, zero-lookup first-level
addressing, manifest-based second-level sub-sharding) but does not itself specify the TRANSITION
from today's monolithic `BC-INDEX.md` body to that end-state — exactly the same gap BC-1.18.008
closes for mechanism A's four append-log backfills. Because `BC-INDEX.md`'s H1-per-BC-row is the
POLICY-7 title source-of-truth, a dropped or duplicated row during this split corrupts title
authority for that BC — this is a governance-integrity-critical migration, not a cosmetic one, and
is modeled directly on BC-1.18.008's structure: byte-for-byte content-preservation, an independent
census verifying every BC row lands in exactly one shard, staging+verify+atomic-replace
crash-atomicity, fail-loud rollback on verification failure, and idempotency against a partial
prior attempt. This BC additionally covers the SS-05/SS-06 second-level sub-split within the SAME
one-time operation, since both subsystems already exceed the provisional cap on their own section
size alone and require immediate sub-sharding at the same F4 activation moment.

## Preconditions

1. BC-1.18.010's end-state addressing scheme (per-subsystem shard files at
   `shards/BC-INDEX-SS-NN.md`, the top-level shard-manifest schema, and the SS-05/SS-06
   second-level manifest schema) is fully specified and available as the TARGET this migration
   produces.
2. BC-1.18.006's atomic-write primitives (temp-file-then-rename staging/publish discipline) are
   implemented and available for reuse — this BC does not invent new atomic-write machinery.
3. `BC-INDEX.md`'s live frontmatter `total_bcs` field is readable and is treated as an independent
   count-oracle against which the pre-split census (Postcondition 2) is cross-checked — not as the
   census itself (the census is a fresh enumeration of the body's actual `BC-X.YY.NNN` rows,
   `total_bcs` is a sanity bound the fresh enumeration must match).
4. The migration is scheduled to execute at F4 activation, at the SAME moment BC-1.18.008's
   mechanism-A backfill-split runs (both are one-time migrations gated on the same F4 activation
   boundary, though they operate on independent artifact sets and have no ordering dependency on
   each other per Postcondition 7).

## Postconditions

1. **Content-preservation, byte-for-byte.** The concatenation of the ten (or more, once
   second-level sub-shards exist) resulting shard files, in `SS-01`..`SS-10` order, plus
   `BC-INDEX.md`'s own retained lean top-level body (`§Summary` + `§Subsystem Shard Manifest` +
   cross-cutting invariants — BC-1.18.010 Postcondition 1's end-state), reproduces the ORIGINAL
   (pre-split) `BC-INDEX.md`'s full per-BC-row content byte-for-byte — modulo the newly-introduced
   `§Subsystem Shard Manifest` section itself, which is new structural metadata, not migrated
   content. This is BC-1.18.008 Postcondition 6(a)'s exact analogue, applied to a content
   partition (by subsystem) instead of a time partition (by seal sequence).

2. **Independent-census integrity check — every BC row in EXACTLY one shard.** Before the split
   begins, capture an independent census: the complete set of `BC-X.YY.NNN` IDs present in the
   ORIGINAL (pre-split) `BC-INDEX.md` body (a fresh enumeration, not reused from any cached count),
   cross-checked against `BC-INDEX.md`'s own `total_bcs` frontmatter field (an independent
   count-oracle, e.g. 2,005 per BC-INDEX v5.52 at the time this BC was authored) as a sanity bound.
   After the split, verify: (a) every census ID appears in EXACTLY ONE resulting shard file
   (`shards/BC-INDEX-SS-NN.md`, or a sub-shard once second-level splitting applies) — never zero,
   never two; (b) the union of all shard files' row counts equals the pre-split census count
   exactly; (c) `BC-INDEX.md`'s own body, post-split, contains ZERO per-BC table rows (BC-1.18.010
   Invariant 3). This is BC-1.18.008 Postcondition 6(b)'s exact analogue (record-integrity),
   specialized to BC-INDEX's ID-keyed partition instead of decision-log's row-boundary partition,
   and is the "independent census" check BC-1.18.010 already specifies for the STEADY STATE — this
   migration BC specifies the ONE-TIME check that establishes that steady state correctly in the
   first place.

3. **Crash-atomicity: staging + verify + atomic replace, all-or-nothing.** Write all ten (or more)
   resulting shard files and the shard-manifest TOML to a staging location first; only after
   Postcondition 1 (content-preservation) and Postcondition 2 (independent census) both verify
   clean does the operation atomically replace `BC-INDEX.md`'s body and publish the shard-manifest
   at its canonical path, via the same temp-file-then-rename discipline BC-1.18.006 already
   establishes. This is BC-1.18.008 Postcondition 5's exact analogue.

4. **Rollback on verification failure.** If EITHER the content-preservation check OR the
   independent-census check fails, the migration ABORTS: `BC-INDEX.md`'s original monolithic body
   is left completely untouched (fail-loud, not partial-and-silent) — no partial set of shard files
   is ever treated as authoritative, and no partial `§Subsystem Shard Manifest` is published. This
   is BC-1.18.008 Postcondition 6's "hard gate" analogue and its EC-004's exact analogue.

5. **Idempotency against a partially-completed prior attempt.** If a prior migration attempt left a
   valid partial shard-index/manifest state, re-running MUST either resume from the last
   verified-complete shard or detect the already-migrated state and skip re-splitting — never
   double-split. This is BC-1.18.008 Invariant 3's exact analogue.

6. **MUST cover the SS-05/SS-06 second-level sub-split within the SAME one-time migration
   operation, not a separate follow-on.** Both subsystems already exceed the provisional cap on
   their own section size alone (SS-05 ~88,695 bytes / 661 BCs; SS-06 ~85,407 bytes / 592 BCs,
   both measured 2026-09-05) and require immediate second-level sub-sharding at the SAME F4
   activation moment mechanism A's own backfill (BC-1.18.008) runs. This BC's content-preservation,
   independent-census, atomicity, and rollback obligations (Postconditions 1-5 above) apply
   IDENTICALLY at the sub-shard level for SS-05/SS-06 — i.e., the census for SS-05 verifies every
   `BC-5.YY.NNN` row lands in exactly one of `shards/BC-INDEX-SS-05.a.md`/`.b.md`/etc., with the
   SS-05-scoped total matching an independent pre-split count of `BC-5.*` rows specifically.

7. **No new Cohort-B dependency.** Unlike BC-1.18.008 (which BC-7.08.001's fail-closed flip depends
   on, since `regression-gate`/`convergence-tracker` read the four mechanism-A artifacts), this
   migration has NO Cohort-B sequencing dependency: the F2 architecture-delta doc's §5
   migration-impact map confirms `regression-gate`/`convergence-tracker` do not read `BC-INDEX.md`.
   `BC-7.08.001`'s scope and gating conditions are UNCHANGED by this BC.

8. **Relationships.** This BC depends on BC-1.18.010 (the end-state addressing scheme this
   migration produces) and BC-1.18.006 (reuses its atomic-write primitives) — the same "applies an
   existing primitive retroactively, once" relationship BC-1.18.008 has to BC-1.18.006, mirrored
   here for B2's own end-state BC.

## Invariants

1. **This BC's migration logic is a caller of BC-1.18.006's atomic-write primitives, not a
   reimplementation.** The migration reuses the SAME temp-file-then-rename atomic-write pattern
   BC-1.18.006 defines for the ongoing per-write case — this BC differs only in WHEN it runs (once,
   at F4 activation) and WHAT it operates on (BC-INDEX's existing body, partitioned by subsystem,
   rather than a single new append).

2. **No BC row is ever counted twice or dropped.** The independent census (Postcondition 2) is the
   sole source of truth for "did every row survive the split" — a migration that passes
   content-preservation (Postcondition 1) but fails the census (e.g., a byte-identical
   concatenation that nonetheless duplicates one row and drops another via a compensating error)
   is STILL a failing migration; both checks are independently mandatory, neither substitutes for
   the other.

3. **The migration is never partially applied.** At every observable point in time — before the
   migration runs, during staging, and after it completes — `BC-INDEX.md`'s body is either the
   FULL original monolithic form or the FULL split end-state form; it is never observed in a state
   where some subsystems are split and others are not (this BC operates on all ten subsystems, plus
   SS-05/SS-06's second-level sub-split, as one atomic unit — Postcondition 3/6).

4. **This BC's own execution does NOT gate BC-7.08.001's Cohort B flip.** Per Postcondition 7, no
   implementation may introduce an undocumented sequencing dependency between this migration and
   the Cohort B fail-closed flip; the two are independent one-time operations that happen to be
   scheduled at the same F4 activation boundary.

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | Content-preservation (Postcondition 1) passes but independent census (Postcondition 2) finds a duplicated row across two shard files | Migration ABORTS per Postcondition 4 — passing ONE check is not sufficient; both are independently mandatory (Invariant 2) |
| EC-002 | Migration crashes after writing 6 of 10 first-level shard files to staging | Postcondition 3's atomicity guarantee: `BC-INDEX.md`'s original body is untouched (staging was incomplete and never promoted); the partial staged output is discarded on the next attempt, which restarts cleanly |
| EC-003 | A prior migration attempt left a complete, verified shard set in staging but crashed before the atomic-replace step | Re-running MUST detect the verified-complete staged state and resume directly to the atomic-replace step, not re-run the full split from scratch (Postcondition 5's idempotency, resume-from-verified-checkpoint variant) |
| EC-004 | SS-05's second-level sub-split (Postcondition 6) produces sub-shards `.a`/`.b`/`.c` whose combined row count does not match an independent pre-split count of `BC-5.*` rows | Migration ABORTS for the entire operation (not just SS-05) per Postcondition 4 — a sub-shard-level census failure is treated with the same severity as a top-level census failure, since a partial-success outcome (nine subsystems split correctly, SS-05 corrupted) would still violate Invariant 3's all-or-nothing guarantee |
| EC-005 | An implementer mistakenly makes this migration a precondition for BC-7.08.001's Cohort B flip | Scope violation of Postcondition 7/Invariant 4 — the F2 architecture-delta doc's migration-impact map already confirms zero dependency; this BC introduces none |
| EC-006 | The migration is re-run after already completing successfully (no partial state, fully migrated) | Idempotent no-op: the migration detects `BC-INDEX.md`'s body is already in the split end-state (zero per-BC rows remain in the body, per BC-1.18.010 Invariant 3) and exits without re-splitting or re-writing any shard file |

## Canonical Test Vectors

| Input | Expected Output | Category |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| `BC-INDEX.md` at 2,005 total BCs across 10 `### SS-NN` sections, `total_bcs: 2005` in frontmatter | Pre-split census enumerates exactly 2,005 unique `BC-X.YY.NNN` IDs, matching `total_bcs`; post-split, the union of all 10 (or more, with SS-05/SS-06 sub-shards) shard files' row counts is exactly 2,005; `BC-INDEX.md`'s body retains zero per-BC rows | happy-path |
| SS-05 (661 BCs, ~88,695 bytes) and SS-06 (592 BCs, ~85,407 bytes) both exceed the provisional cap | Both receive second-level sub-splits (e.g. SS-05 → `.a`/`.b`/`.c`) in the SAME migration operation; SS-05's sub-shard row counts sum to exactly 661, SS-06's to exactly 592 | happy-path |
| Content-preservation check finds a byte mismatch (one row's trailing whitespace altered during extraction) | Migration ABORTS; original `BC-INDEX.md` body untouched; fail-loud error surfaced (E-SHD-005) | error |
| Independent census finds a `BC-3.14.002` row present in BOTH `shards/BC-INDEX-SS-03.md` and (erroneously) `shards/BC-INDEX-SS-04.md` | Migration ABORTS per Postcondition 4/EC-001; fail-loud error surfaced (E-SHD-005) naming the duplicated ID | error |
| Migration crashes mid-staging, restarted from scratch | Original `BC-INDEX.md` byte-identical to pre-crash state; restart produces the same split result as an uninterrupted run | error |
| Migration re-run after a prior successful completion | No-op: zero shard files rewritten, `BC-INDEX.md` body unchanged (EC-006) | edge-case |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| (pending) | Content-preservation invariant — concatenation of all resulting first-level (and, where applicable, second-level) shard files in `SS-01`..`SS-10` order plus the retained lean top-level body reproduces the original monolithic `BC-INDEX.md` body byte-for-byte, modulo the new `§Subsystem Shard Manifest` section | proptest / golden-file round-trip against the live (or a synthetic fixture) `BC-INDEX.md` body |
| (pending) | Independent-census integrity invariant — every `BC-X.YY.NNN` ID in the pre-split census appears in EXACTLY ONE post-split shard (or sub-shard) file; the union of all shard row counts equals the pre-split census count; `BC-INDEX.md`'s post-split body contains zero per-BC rows | integration test (full-corpus census comparison against synthetic fixtures with known BC-ID sets, including a duplicated-row negative-control fixture) |
| (pending) | Atomicity-under-interruption invariant — a simulated crash at any staging step leaves `BC-INDEX.md`'s body either fully original or fully split, never a partial/corrupt intermediate state | fault-injection / integration test (simulated crash at each of N staging steps; assert post-recovery state is one of the two valid states) |
| (pending) | Idempotency invariant — running the migration twice against an already-split `BC-INDEX.md`, or resuming from a verified-complete staged state, does not re-split, re-duplicate, or corrupt any shard | integration test (double-invocation + resume-from-staged-checkpoint fixtures) |
| (pending) | SS-05/SS-06 second-level sub-split coverage invariant — the same content-preservation/census/atomicity/rollback obligations hold at the sub-shard level for SS-05 and SS-06 specifically, verified against an independent `BC-5.*`/`BC-6.*`-scoped count | integration test (sub-shard-scoped census comparison for SS-05/SS-06 fixtures) |
| (pending) | No-new-Cohort-B-dependency invariant — this BC's migration completion is never referenced as a precondition in `hooks-registry.toml`'s `failure_policy` deployment sequencing for `regression-gate`/`convergence-tracker` | static-check (config/PR-template audit confirming BC-7.08.001's gating conditions cite only BC-1.18.005/006/008, never this BC) |

VP IDs are pending VP-INDEX allocation by formal-verifier (S-25.02 F2 verification-property
extension follow-on burst). Per the established project convention (e.g. BC-5.39.006's `(pending)`
rows), this BC's VPs are enumerated here as an explicit input for formal-verifier, analogous to
VP-123/VP-124 (BC-1.18.008's content-preservation + atomicity/idempotency pair) but keyed to
BC-INDEX's ID-census model instead of decision-log's byte-count model.

## Related BCs

- BC-1.18.008 — this BC's structure is modeled directly on BC-1.18.008's governed one-time-migration pattern (content-preservation, census, atomicity, rollback, idempotency), substituting a content partition (by subsystem) for a time partition (by seal sequence) (related to)
- BC-1.18.010 — this BC governs the ONE-TIME transition to BC-1.18.010's end-state addressing scheme; BC-1.18.010 specifies the end-state, this BC specifies the transition (depends on)
- BC-1.18.006 — this BC reuses BC-1.18.006's atomic-write primitives (staging + verify + atomic replace) (depends on)
- BC-1.18.005 — the shard-cap formula that determines whether SS-05/SS-06 (and, empirically, any other subsystem) require second-level sub-sharding (related to)
- BC-7.08.001 — explicitly has NO dependency on this BC (Postcondition 7); cited here only to document the absence of a relationship an implementer might otherwise assume by analogy to BC-1.18.008 (related to)

## Architecture Anchors

- `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/shard_manager.rs` — one-time migration entry point for the B2 body split, reusing BC-1.18.006's staging/atomic-replace primitives
- `.factory/specs/behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md` §Summary / `total_bcs` frontmatter field — the independent count-oracle this BC's census check (Postcondition 2) cross-checks against
- `.factory/specs/architecture/ARCH-INDEX.md` §Subsystem Registry — the `BC-S Prefix`→`SS-NN` mapping this BC's per-subsystem partition boundaries follow (same mapping BC-1.18.010 Postcondition 2 reuses)

## SDK Grounding Evidence

Literal stable-anchor greps substantiating this BC's external-artifact claims (POLICY 5;
no `grep -n` / no file:line citations per TD-VSDD-091):

```
$ grep -oE "^pub fn write_atomic" crates/last-amended-migrate/src/atomic_write.rs
pub fn write_atomic
```

```
$ grep -oE "^pub fn write_indeterminate_marker" crates/factory-dispatcher/src/indeterminate_marker.rs
pub fn write_indeterminate_marker
```

Confirms both existing atomic-write primitives (`write_atomic`, `write_indeterminate_marker`) this
BC's Invariant 1 states are reused, not reimplemented, for the staging+verify+atomic-replace
sequence (Postcondition 3).

```
$ grep -oE "^total_bcs: [0-9]+" .factory/specs/behavioral-contracts/BC-INDEX.md
total_bcs: 2005
```

Confirms the live `total_bcs` frontmatter field's current value, grounding this BC's Postcondition
2 independent-count-oracle claim (the exact figure is expected to change as BC-INDEX grows further
before F4 execution — this BC's own authoring-time snapshot, not a literal migration input, mirrors
BC-1.18.008 Precondition 3's identical illustrative-scale caveat).

```
$ grep -oE "^\*\*CAP-04[123] " .factory/specs/domain-spec/capabilities.md
**CAP-041 
**CAP-042 
**CAP-043 
```

Confirms CAP-043's existence, grounding this BC's capability anchor.

S-25.02 — Artifact Sharding Layer 2: Size-Triggered Shard Rotation for Cycle Artifacts

## VP Anchors

- (pending) — formal-verifier allocates new VP-NNN(s) analogous to VP-123/VP-124 (content-preservation + record-integrity; atomicity-under-interruption + idempotency) but keyed to BC-INDEX's ID-census model instead of decision-log's byte-count model, per the F2 architecture-delta doc §4a authorship input for this BC. Six candidate properties are enumerated in `## Verification Properties` above as formal-verifier's starting input.

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | CAP-043 |
| Capability Anchor Justification | Anchoring to CAP-043: "Artifact Sharding Layer 2: Size-Triggered Shard Rotation for Cycle Append-Logs and BC-INDEX Structured-Catalog Sharding" — because this BC describes the governed one-time migration that establishes mechanism B2's split end-state (BC-1.18.010) correctly and safely for `BC-INDEX.md`, which is exactly what CAP-043 defines per `capabilities.md` §CAP-043: "This capability has two mechanisms for two artifact shapes: mechanism A shards four append-only cycle logs... mechanism B shards `BC-INDEX.md`... via two sub-mechanisms: B1... and B2 splits the file's ten already-existing `### SS-NN` per-subsystem body sections into individually-addressable shard files." CAP-043 ("Artifact Sharding Layer 2: Size-Triggered Shard Rotation for Cycle Append-Logs and BC-INDEX Structured-Catalog Sharding") per capabilities.md §CAP-043 — no existing capability other than CAP-043 covers a governed one-time migration establishing B2's split end-state; CAP-041 (INDETERMINATE detection/quarantine) and CAP-042 (the `rotate_changelog`/`last_amended` write-path fix) are both distinguishable per capabilities.md's own CAP-043 entry, and neither covers a BC-INDEX body-structure migration. |

Governed one-time migration for mechanism B2's BC-INDEX body split: byte-for-byte content-preservation, independent-census integrity (every BC row in exactly one shard, cross-checked against `total_bcs`), staging+verify+atomic-replace crash-atomicity, fail-loud rollback on verification failure, idempotency against a partial prior attempt, and the SS-05/SS-06 second-level sub-split covered within the SAME one-time operation.
