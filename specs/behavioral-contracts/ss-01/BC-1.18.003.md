# BC-1.18.003: Successful Re-Validation Clears the Unvalidated-Mutation Marker (Idempotent; Operator Escape Hatch Supported)

## Description

The `.factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` lifecycle has two supported clear paths. Primary
path: when the same plugin that produced INDETERMINATE is subsequently dispatched PostToolUse on
the same artifact and produces `DispatchOutcome::Pass` (exit_code=0, `host_output_too_large_seen=false`),
the dispatcher deletes the marker file. Secondary path: the operator manually deletes the marker
via `rm .factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` — a fully supported and documented escape hatch
requiring no special command or credential. Both clear paths unblock the two gate arms
simultaneously. The clear operation is idempotent: if the marker is absent at delete time, the
operation is a no-op (no error). A failed re-validation (FAIL outcome) does NOT clear the marker.

## Preconditions

1. `.factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` exists (was written by a prior fail-closed PostToolUse
   INDETERMINATE event per BC-1.18.001 PC4).
2. For the primary clear path (PC1): The same plugin named in the marker's `plugin_name` field
   is dispatched again in a PostToolUse event on the same artifact (or a write to the same artifact
   path).
3. The operator has shell access to the session's working directory for the secondary escape-hatch
   path (PC3).

## Postconditions

1. **Successful re-validation deletes the marker.** When the plugin named in the marker's
   `plugin_name` field is dispatched in a PostToolUse hook and produces `DispatchOutcome::Pass`
   (exit_code=0, `host_output_too_large_seen=false`), the dispatcher executes
   `delete_marker_if_pass` and deletes `.factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker`. After deletion,
   the subsequent `^Agent$` dispatch AND the next `git commit`/`git push` Bash dispatch are
   allowed by the gate (BC-1.18.002 PC4 path — marker absent → both arms pass). Clearance is
   scoped to the same plugin: if a DIFFERENT plugin produces PASS on the same artifact, the
   marker is NOT cleared.

2. **Absent-marker clear is idempotent.** If `.factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` is absent
   at delete time, `delete_marker_if_pass` is a no-op — it does NOT return an error and does
   NOT create a new file. The session remains operational. This covers the case where the marker
   was already cleared by a previous action (race-free semantics).

3. **Operator manual escape hatch.** `rm .factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` is a fully
   supported operator action. No special command, no credential, no sentinel file, and no
   Agent dispatch is required. After the file is deleted, the next `^Agent$` dispatch and the
   next `git commit`/`git push` Bash dispatch proceed without block. This matches the break-glass
   posture from ADR-039 §Decision 3: authentication is by possession of shell access to the
   machine running the session.

## Invariants

1. **FAIL re-validation preserves the marker.** If the re-validating plugin produces FAIL
   (exit_code!=0), the marker is NOT deleted. The unvalidated state persists until either a
   successful re-validation (PC1) or manual clearance (PC3). This is the correct behavior: FAIL
   means the validator checked the write and found a blocking condition — the mutation should not
   proceed until the condition is resolved.

2. **Clear is scoped to the named plugin.** Only the plugin whose name matches `plugin_name` in
   the marker can trigger the automatic clear on PASS. A different plugin producing PASS on the
   same artifact does NOT clear the marker. The named-plugin clear is deterministic and auditable.

3. **Both gate arms unblocked simultaneously.** A single marker deletion (by any clear path)
   unblocks both Arm 1 (Agent dispatch) and Arm 2 (git commit/push Bash) simultaneously. No
   per-arm unblock is needed.

4. **Idempotent delete must not error.** The `delete_marker_if_pass` function MUST use
   `fs::remove_file` and silently swallow `io::ErrorKind::NotFound`. Any other IO error
   (permissions, filesystem failure) MUST be propagated as an error to the caller (not silently
   swallowed) — the session must surface a real filesystem problem rather than masking it.

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | Re-validating plugin produces FAIL (exit_code=1) | Marker NOT deleted. Gate remains active. Unvalidated state persists. |
| EC-002 | Re-validating plugin fuel-exhausts again (INDETERMINATE) on re-run | Marker overwritten with new event (single-marker last-writer-wins per BC-1.18.001 Invariant 3). Gate remains active. |
| EC-003 | Different plugin produces PASS on same artifact | Marker NOT cleared (clear is scoped to named plugin per Invariant 2). |
| EC-004 | Marker absent at delete time (idempotent delete) | No-op. No error. Session continues. |
| EC-005 | Operator runs `rm .factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` | Both gate arms immediately unblocked. Next Agent dispatch and git commit/push proceed. |
| EC-006 | Marker file has wrong permissions (delete fails) | `delete_marker_if_pass` propagates IO error (NOT silently swallowed). Session surfaces the failure. |
| EC-007 | CI environment has stale marker from prior run | `rm -f .factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` in CI setup step clears it; test harness proceeds. Stale marker should be treated as a CI setup artifact, not a validation requirement. |

## Canonical Test Vectors

| Scenario | Input State | Expected Outcome |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Same plugin PASS on same artifact | Marker exists (plugin_name="regression-gate"), then "regression-gate" dispatched PostToolUse → PASS | Marker deleted; gate allows subsequent Agent and git-commit dispatches |
| Same plugin FAIL on same artifact | Marker exists, then same plugin dispatched → FAIL | Marker NOT deleted; gate still active |
| Different plugin PASS on same artifact | Marker exists (plugin_name="regression-gate"), then "convergence-tracker" → PASS | Marker NOT deleted (different plugin) |
| Idempotent delete — marker absent | No marker; `delete_marker_if_pass` called | No-op; no error |
| Manual escape hatch | Marker exists; operator runs `rm .factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker` | Marker gone; next Agent dispatch allowed |
| INDETERMINATE on re-run | Marker exists; same plugin fuel-exhausts again | Marker overwritten with new event; gate remains active |

## Related BCs

- BC-1.18.001 — writes the marker; this BC defines how it is cleared (composes with)
- BC-1.18.002 — gate behavior while marker exists and when absent; this BC controls the transition from blocked to unblocked (composes with)
- BC-1.18.004 — fail-open advisory-only behavior; fail-open INDETERMINATE never writes a marker so this BC's clear is never needed for fail-open plugins (sibling)

## Architecture Anchors

- `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/indeterminate_marker.rs` — `delete_marker_if_pass(outcome, policy, dir) -> Result<(), io::Error>`; idempotent `fs::remove_file` with `NotFound` swallowed; `should_write_marker(outcome, policy) -> bool` predicate used by executor to determine whether to write or skip marker
- `crates/factory-dispatcher/src/executor.rs` — calls `delete_marker_if_pass` after a PostToolUse PASS on any fail-closed plugin; same module as the INDETERMINATE classification in BC-1.18.001

## VP Anchors

- VP-106 — Successful Re-Validation Deletes Marker; fail-open INDETERMINATE Writes No Marker (unit-test; covers PC1, PC2 idempotent delete, Invariant 1 FAIL-preserves, Invariant 4)

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| VP-106 | PASS re-validation (same plugin) deletes `.factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker`; deletion is idempotent (no error when marker already absent) | unit-test |
| VP-106 | FAIL re-validation does NOT delete marker; marker persists until PASS or manual deletion | unit-test |
| VP-106 | `should_write_marker(Indeterminate, FailOpen) == false`; `should_write_marker(Indeterminate, FailClosed) == true` | unit-test |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | CAP-041 |
| Capability Anchor Justification | CAP-041 ("Validation Integrity: INDETERMINATE Outcome, Durable Mutation Marker, and Next-Advance Gate") per capabilities.md §CAP-041 — this BC specifies the marker-clear lifecycle that completes the quarantine loop defined in CAP-041: "The marker is cleared by successful re-validation (same plugin, PASS outcome) or manual operator deletion (`rm .factory/unvalidated-mutation.marker`)." |
| L2 Domain Invariants | none (dispatcher runtime marker lifecycle invariant, not L2 domain spec) |
| Architecture Module | SS-01 (Hook Dispatcher Core — `delete_marker_if_pass` and `should_write_marker` in `indeterminate_marker.rs`; `executor.rs` clear call-site) |
| ADR | ADR-047 §Decision 5 (Marker Clear Protocol — Condition A successful re-validation; Condition B manual operator escape hatch; clear-on-PASS not clear-on-FAIL; idempotent delete; named-plugin scoping); ADR-047 §Decision 9 (both gate arms unblocked simultaneously by single marker deletion) |
