# Behavioral Contract BC-7.04.013: validate-demo-evidence-story-scoped: identity & registry binding

## Description

validate-demo-evidence-story-scoped: identity & registry binding. POL-010 enforcer; on_error=continue.

**Source category:** Validator hook scripts (validate-* and verify-*).
**Audit ID:** `BC-AUDIT-1104` (extracted from `pass-3-deep-hooks.md` line 1163).
**Hook script:** ``plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/validate-demo-evidence-story-scoped.sh``.
**Registry entry:** `hooks-registry.toml:176-194` (PostToolUse, tool=`Edit|Write`, priority=270, timeout_ms=5000, on_error=continue)..

## Preconditions

1. Hook event/tool match: PostToolUse Edit|Write..

## Postconditions

1. Behavior: POL-010 enforcer; on_error=continue.
2. Exit codes: 0 / 2.

## Invariants

1. Hook script identity (script path) and registry binding remain stable across the contract lifetime.
2. Exit-code semantics conform to the dispatcher contract: 0 = allow / advisory, 2 = block, 1 = jq-missing-fail-closed (where applicable).

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | TBD | TBD |

## Canonical Test Vectors

> Golden-file test inputs and expected outputs. Used for regression testing and agent validation.

| Input | Expected Output | Category |
|-------|-----------------|----------|
| TBD | TBD | happy-path |
| TBD edge-case | TBD | edge-case |
| TBD error-case | TBD | error |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| VP-TBD | TBD — to be assigned during VP synthesis | manual |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | TBD |
| L2 Domain Invariants | TBD |
| Architecture Module | SS-07 (Hook Bash Layer) |
| Stories | TBD (filled by story-writer) |

## Related BCs (Recommended)

- TBD — to be cross-linked during BC graph synthesis.

## Architecture Anchors (Recommended)

- `architecture/ss-07-hook-bash.md` — anchor TBD.

## Story Anchor (Recommended)

TBD — story will be assigned during story-writer phase.

## VP Anchors (Recommended)

- TBD — VP linkage to be added during VP synthesis.

### Brownfield-Specific Sections

#### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | ``plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/validate-demo-evidence-story-scoped.sh`` |
| **Confidence** | high |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |
| **Source Document** | `pass-3-deep-hooks.md` line 1163 |
| **Audit ID** | `BC-AUDIT-1104` |
| **Source Line(s) (within hook)** | Header 1-12. |

#### Evidence Types Used

- **guard clause**: explicit validation check in the hook script body (regex / substring / glob match).
- **documentation**: `hooks-registry.toml` declares the binding tuple (event, tool, priority, on_error).

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| **I/O operations** | reads + writes (stdin JSON, stderr diagnostics, optional event emission via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/emit-event`) |
| **Global state access** | reads global (env vars: `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, optionally `VSDD_*`) |
| **Deterministic** | yes — bash hooks are deterministic given identical stdin envelope and filesystem state |
| **Thread safety** | not applicable (subprocess-isolated invocation per hook fire) |
| **Overall classification** | effectful shell |

#### Refactoring Notes

Bash hook scripts are inherently effectful (stdin/stderr, optional event emit, optional state-file reads). Native (Rust) replacement would extract pure parse/decision logic from the I/O shell, exposing a `fn(payload) -> HookResult` contract per BC-7.02.009. Until that port lands, the contract is preserved by the script body verbatim and the registry binding tuple.
