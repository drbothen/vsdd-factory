# Behavioral Contract BC-6.08.025: responsive-validation: screenshot evidence + per-screen pass/fail matrix

## Description

responsive-validation: screenshot evidence + per-screen pass/fail matrix. Confidence: HIGH. Extracted from `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/responsive-validation/SKILL.md` (lines 70-115).

## Preconditions

1. Per-screen test cycle.

## Postconditions

1. Stores screenshots at `.factory/ui-evidence/SCR-NNN/{mobile-375,tablet-768,desktop-1024,wide-1440,CMP-NNN-default,CMP-NNN-loading,CMP-NNN-error}.png`; emits `responsive-report.md` with per-screen P/F matrix.

## Invariants

1. TBD — invariants not separately enumerated in source; see Acceptance for verification surface.

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | TBD | TBD |

## Canonical Test Vectors

| Input | Expected Output | Category |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Trigger condition met | Behavior executed; acceptance criteria satisfied | happy-path |
| Trigger condition absent | Skill is no-op (or alternative path per skill body) | edge-case |
| Acceptance criterion violated | TBD — failure path per skill failure-modes section | error |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| (TBD — to be assigned in Phase 1.6c) | Acceptance: Quality gate: screenshots captured per screen; report shows pass-rate %. | manual |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | CAP-TBD |
| L2 Domain Invariants | TBD |
| Architecture Module | plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/responsive-validation/SKILL.md |
| Stories | TBD |

## Related BCs (Recommended)

- TBD — sibling BCs in same skill (see other BCs for `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/responsive-validation/SKILL.md` in this directory)

## Architecture Anchors (Recommended)

- `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/responsive-validation/SKILL.md` — defining skill body for this contract

## Story Anchor (Recommended)

TBD

## VP Anchors (Recommended)

- [TBD — to be assigned in Phase 1.6c] — Quality gate: screenshots captured per screen; report shows pass-rate %.

### Brownfield-Specific Sections

#### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/responsive-validation/SKILL.md` |
| **Confidence** | high |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |
| **Source Lines** | 70-115 |
| **Audit ID** | BC-AUDIT-656 |

#### Evidence Types Used

- **documentation**: stated in SKILL.md body and frontmatter (declarative skill-spec evidence)
- **inferred**: triggers and acceptance conditions derived from skill prose

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **I/O operations** | TBD — depends on skill (most skills perform reads + writes via allowed-tools) |
| **Global state access** | TBD |
| **Deterministic** | TBD — most skills are deterministic given identical inputs and allowed-tools surface |
| **Thread safety** | not applicable (skills run sequentially within a Claude Code session) |
| **Overall classification** | mixed |

#### Refactoring Notes

This contract codifies a SKILL.md-driven behavior. The skill body is the canonical specification; this BC extracts the procedural contract for downstream verification. No code refactor implied — refinement of the SKILL.md or its templates would be the corrective surface.
