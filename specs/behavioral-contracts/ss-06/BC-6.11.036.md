# Behavioral Contract BC-6.11.036: multi-repo-health: Story-repo cross-check warns when stories reference undetected repo or repo lacks stories

## Description

"Cross-check against `.factory/stories/` — warn if a repo has no stories, or if there are stories targeting an undetected repo.". Acceptance: Both warning conditions.

## Preconditions

1. Repos detected.

## Postconditions

1. "Cross-check against `.factory/stories/` — warn if a repo has no stories, or if there are stories targeting an undetected repo."

## Invariants

1. Both warning conditions.

### Brownfield-Specific Sections

#### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/multi-repo-phase-0-synthesis/SKILL.md` (164 LOC)` |
| **Confidence** | high |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |
| **Audit Source ID** | BC-AUDIT-469 |
| **Source Line(s)** | 19 |
| **Source File** | `.factory/phase-0-ingestion/pass-3-deep-skills-batch-2.md` |

#### Evidence Types Used

- **documentation**: extracted from SKILL.md frontmatter and Quality Gate sections

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **I/O operations** | reads + writes (skill orchestrates filesystem and agent dispatch) |
| **Global state access** | reads global (STATE.md, .factory/ tree) |
| **Deterministic** | no -- depends on agent execution and human approval |
| **Thread safety** | not thread-safe |
| **Overall classification** | effectful shell |

#### Refactoring Notes

This BC describes a skill-level workflow contract. The acceptance criteria
encode the Quality Gate checks performed by the skill; these can be lifted
into automated assertions where the skill's underlying procedure is
deterministic. Adversarial and human-gated steps are explicitly opaque.
