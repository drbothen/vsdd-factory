# Behavioral Contract BC-6.16.021: phase-1d-adversarial-spec-review: Adversary reviews 7 categories — ambiguity, missing edges, implicit assumptions, contradictions, testable-vs-provable, purity, tool mismatch

## Description

Adversary reviews for: ambiguous language, missing edge cases, implicit unstated assumptions, contradictions between sections, "testable only" properties that should be provable, purity boundary violations, verification tool mismatches. Acceptance: Seven review categories.

## Preconditions

1. Spawning adversary.

## Postconditions

1. Adversary reviews for: ambiguous language, missing edge cases, implicit unstated assumptions, contradictions between sections, "testable only" properties that should be provable, purity boundary violations, verification tool mismatches.

## Invariants

1. Seven review categories.

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | TBD | TBD |

## Canonical Test Vectors

### Brownfield-Specific Sections

#### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/phase-1d-adversarial-spec-review/SKILL.md` |
| **Confidence** | high |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |
| **Audit Source ID** | BC-AUDIT-506 |
| **Source Line(s)** | 32-44 (Step 2) |
| **Source File** | `.factory/phase-0-ingestion/pass-3-deep-skills-batch-2.md` |

#### Evidence Types Used

- **documentation**: extracted from SKILL.md frontmatter and Quality Gate sections

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **I/O operations** | reads + writes (skill orchestrates filesystem and agent dispatch) |
| **Global state access** | reads global (STATE.md, .factory/ tree) |
| **Deterministic** | no -- depends on agent execution and human approval |
| **Thread safety** | not thread-safe |
| **Overall classification** | effectful shell |

#### Refactoring Notes

This BC describes a skill-level workflow contract. The acceptance criteria
encode the Quality Gate checks performed by the skill; these can be lifted
into automated assertions where the skill's underlying procedure is
deterministic. Adversarial and human-gated steps are explicitly opaque.
