# BC-4.16.001: validate-factory-path-staging WASM PreToolUse guard MUST block any `git add` or `git stage` command that stages a path under `.factory/` on a product branch, and MUST pass all non-`.factory/` staging commands unconditionally

## Description

The `validate-factory-path-staging` native-WASM plugin enforces the nested-worktree path-exclusivity
invariant (INV-E21-001): no path under the `.factory/` physical directory may be tracked on a
product branch (`develop`, `main`, `feature/*`, `release/*`, `maintenance/*`). It fires on every
`PreToolUse` event where the Bash tool payload contains a `git add` or `git stage` command in
any form — bare (`git add`, `git stage`), with global options before the subcommand (e.g.,
`git -C <path> add`, `git --no-pager add`, `git -c key=val add`), or where `git` is glued to
leading shell punctuation (`$(git add ...`, `(git add ...`, or backtick-git forms — the
detector strips leading `$(`, `(`, or a leading backtick from candidate tokens before matching)
— anywhere in the payload including chained forms (`&&`, `;`, `|`). (`git stage` is a true git synonym for `git add` and
creates the identical dual-tracking condition.) On invocation, the plugin inspects the staged
paths in the command: if any path matches `.factory/**` (or `\.factory/` as a component, matched
case-insensitively to cover case-folding filesystems such as macOS HFS+ and Windows NTFS —
e.g., `.Factory/STATE.md` matches) AND the current working branch is a product branch (not
`factory-artifacts`), the plugin emits `block_intent = true` (exit code 2) with an actionable
error. When the command uses a `-C <target>` or `-c core.worktree=<target>` option where
`<target>` is a `.factory`-class path (bare `.factory`, `./.factory`, or any absolute/relative
form ending in `/.factory`, matched case-insensitively), branch detection is performed against
the target directory rather than the CWD (Invariant 6); this preserves the state-manager's
canonical `git -C .factory add ...` workflow on the mounted `factory-artifacts` worktree (target
branch = `factory-artifacts` → PASS) while blocking the same command on an unmounted checkout
(target branch = product branch → BLOCK). All other `git add`/`git stage` commands (in any form)
and all non-`git add`/`git stage` Bash commands pass unconditionally.

This is the **invariant layer** for issue #342. It prevents the dual-tracking condition that makes
product-branch merges dangerous: if no `.factory/` path is ever staged on a product branch, the
git working-tree update triggered by a product-branch merge/checkout cannot delete a path the
nested `.factory/` worktree is serving. The companion **safety-net layer** (BC-5.43.001) intercepts
product-branch merges that would clobber `.factory/` paths even if the invariant layer is bypassed
or preceded by a prior accidental staging.

This BC governs the `validate-factory-path-staging` WASM crate at
`crates/hook-plugins/validate-factory-path-staging/` (new crate to be created by S-21.01; named
per ADR-031 §Decision 3 to avoid collision with `crates/hook-plugins/validate-artifact-path/`
which serves BC-4.11.001 since S-13.01). POLICY 21 (no new shell scripts) is satisfied: the guard
is a native WASM plugin, not a `.sh` file.

## Preconditions

1. A `PreToolUse` event has fired for the `Bash` tool.

2. The Bash tool payload contains a `git add` or `git stage` command. Detection contract: any
   token sequence in the payload beginning with a `git` candidate token — where a candidate
   token is any token that equals `git` after stripping leading shell punctuation (`$(`, `(`,
   or a leading backtick; F-P4-002 — conservative strip) — whose first non-option subcommand
   token is `add` or `stage`. To determine the subcommand token, the detector MUST consume the
   value token of every value-consuming git global option; the canonical value-consuming options
   whose value is a SPACE-SEPARATED subsequent token are: `-C <path>`, `-c <name=value>`,
   `--git-dir <path>`, `--work-tree <path>`, `--namespace <path>`, `--super-prefix <path>`,
   and `--exec-path <path>` (when space-separated; `=`-joined forms such as
   `--git-dir=/foo` are self-contained and do NOT consume the next token as their value). For
   any UNKNOWN dash-prefixed token (a token beginning with `-` that is not in the canonical
   set above and not a known non-value-consuming flag), the detector MUST apply the conservative
   rule: treat it as non-value-consuming and let any subsequent standalone `add` or `stage` token
   in the same command segment trigger detection. Under-match is forbidden; conservative
   over-match is acceptable. The minimum form `git\s+(add|stage)` (substring match,
   case-insensitive) covers the common bare invocation and MUST be retained as a fast path.
   This matcher applies anywhere in the payload, including in chained and sequential command
   forms (`&&`, `;`, `|`) — a `git add` or `git stage` appearing after a semicolon,
   ampersand-pair, or pipe is in scope. `git stage` is a true git synonym for `git add` and
   presents the identical INV-E21-001 dual-tracking vector per ADR-031 §Decision 2 Layer-1. All
   other Bash payloads — including `git commit`, `git push`, `git checkout`, `git merge`, and
   all non-git commands — are NOT in scope for this plugin and pass unconditionally.

   **Precondition 2 note — target-aware inspection (Invariant 6):** The value-consuming detection
   above (v1.5: consuming the token after `-C`, `-c`, `--work-tree`, etc.) continues to apply for
   subcommand determination. When the consumed value for `-C` or the value component of a
   `-c core.worktree=<path>` option names a `.factory`-class path, the guard additionally
   INSPECTS that target directory to determine its branch (Invariant 6). This is target INSPECTION
   of already-consumed values — not a re-classification of those values as staging-path arguments.

   **Sub-NITPICK (F-P5-001):** A dedicated test vector for the `--super-prefix` value-consuming
   option is deferred to test-writer (AC-006 proptest expansion scope).

3. The dispatcher has invoked the `validate-factory-path-staging` WASM plugin. The plugin is
   registered in `hooks-registry.toml` as a PreToolUse handler for `^Bash$` with
   `on_error = "continue"` (fail-open: a crashed or timed-out guard never blocks the session).

4. **Environmental scope:** On checkouts where `.factory/` IS mounted as a live git worktree
   (the standard developer machine layout), `git add .factory/<path>` (plain and `-f`) is typically
   a silent no-op — git declines to stage paths that belong to another worktree. Dual-tracking can
   therefore only ORIGINATE on checkouts where the `.factory/` worktree is NOT mounted: fresh CI
   checkouts, bare or shallow clones, or commits made before the initial `git worktree add` call.
   This plugin's primary protective value is on those unmounted checkout environments; it converts
   a silent failure into an explicit, actionable block. On mounted checkouts it provides defense-in-depth
   against edge cases (detached HEAD, partial teardown, misconfigured worktree).

## Postconditions

### PC1 — Blocked: `git add`/`git stage` of `.factory/` path on a product branch

When the Bash payload contains `git add` or `git stage` AND at least one argument (expanded path
or glob) resolves to a path matching `^\.factory/` (or containing `/.factory/` as a path
component, capturing the unnested form), AND the guard's branch detection reports a product branch
(any branch other than `factory-artifacts`):

1. The plugin returns `block_intent = true` (exit code 2).
2. The plugin emits a blocking error message:
   ```
   BLOCKED: git add/stage of .factory/ path on product branch '<branch>'.
   .factory/ paths are exclusively owned by the factory-artifacts worktree.
   Staging .factory/ content on a product branch creates the dual-tracking condition
   that allows product-branch merges to silently delete factory artifact files.
   If you intended to commit factory artifacts: switch to the .factory/ worktree and
   commit from there on the factory-artifacts branch.
   ```
3. The `git add`/`git stage` command is NOT executed.

**Error variant:** `FactoryPathOnProductBranch`

### PC2 — Passed: `git add`/`git stage` of non-`.factory/` paths

When the Bash payload contains `git add` or `git stage` AND no argument resolves to a
`.factory/`-rooted path, the plugin returns `block_intent = false` (exit code 0). The command
proceeds normally.

### PC3 — Passed: `git add`/`git stage` on `factory-artifacts` branch

When the Bash payload contains `git add` or `git stage` AND the current branch is `factory-artifacts`, the plugin
MUST pass unconditionally regardless of the paths being staged. Factory artifact commits require
staging `.factory/` paths on the `factory-artifacts` branch — that is correct behavior. The plugin
MUST NOT block legitimate factory-artifacts branch staging.

### PC4 — Passed: non-`git add`/`git stage` Bash command

When the Bash payload does NOT contain a `git add` or `git stage` command in any form — bare,
with global options (e.g., `git -C <path> add`, `git --no-pager add`), or with leading shell
punctuation stripped (`$(git add ...`, `(git add ...`, backtick-git forms) — anywhere in the
payload including chained forms — (regardless of paths), the plugin returns `block_intent =
false` (exit code 0) immediately without path inspection.

## Invariants

1. **INV-E21-001 (Nested Worktree Path Exclusivity) — instantiation:** No `git add` or `git stage`
   command executed via the Bash tool on a product branch may stage a path under `.factory/`. This
   invariant prevents the dual-tracking condition: `.factory/` paths tracked on a product branch
   are a P0 data-loss landmine (issue #342 root cause).

2. **Fail-open on crash:** A crashed or timed-out `validate-factory-path-staging` plugin MUST
   return `block_intent = false` (pass-through). The guard MUST be registered with
   `on_error = "continue"`. A broken guard is disruptive but never wedges the session.

3. **Branch detection source:** The plugin detects the current product branch via `host::exec_subprocess`
   (`git branch --show-current` or equivalent). If branch detection fails (git unavailable, detached
   HEAD, non-zero exit), the plugin MUST fail-open (pass-through). Uncertain branch state is NOT
   a blocking condition.

4. **Path matching is conservative and case-insensitive:** The path pattern `.factory/` is
   matched as a literal path prefix or path component, **case-insensitively** (e.g.,
   `.Factory/STATE.md` and `.FACTORY/STATE.md` are treated as matching `.factory/`; macOS HFS+
   and Windows NTFS are case-folding filesystems where `git add .Factory/STATE.md` targets the
   same file as `git add .factory/STATE.md` and MUST be blocked conservatively). Glob expansions
   in the `git add`/`git stage` argument are NOT
   evaluated by the `validate-factory-path-staging` plugin at PreToolUse time (git has not yet
   run); the plugin inspects only the literal argument text. The following argument forms are
   treated as conservatively blocking when the detected branch is a product branch:
   - `-A` / `--all` / `-u` / `--update` flags (may stage tracked `.factory/` paths)
   - `.` (CWD-relative; may expand to `.factory/**` when CWD is the project root or `.factory/`)
   - `./` (CWD-relative with explicit slash; semantically identical to `.` for staging purposes)
   - bare `.factory` without trailing slash (git expands this to `.factory/**`, identical staging scope)
   - glob patterns (e.g., `*.md`) that may expand to include `.factory/**` paths
   - `:/`-family pathspec-magic arguments (e.g., `:/`, `:/path`) which anchor from the repository
     root and can include `.factory/` paths regardless of CWD
   Any of the above forms blocks with a conservative `FactoryPathOnProductBranch` message. (Per
   ADR-031 §Decision 2 Layer-1: scope is narrow — `git add`/`git stage` only; `git pull`/`git
   merge` interception is Layer-2's responsibility and MUST NOT be added to this guard.)

5. **No overlap with BC-4.13.001:** `verify-factory-lock` (BC-4.13.001) guards against concurrent
   write races on Edit/Write/MultiEdit/Agent tool calls using the lock mechanism. This plugin
   guards against a different surface (Bash-tool `git add`/`git stage` of `.factory/` paths on
   product branches). Both plugins may fire on the same dispatch; they are additive guards, not
   substitutes.

6. **Target-aware branch detection for `-C` and `-c core.worktree=` forms:** When Precondition 2
   identifies a `git add`/`git stage` command that contains a `-C <target>` option or a
   `-c core.worktree=<target>` option (via the `-c name=value` global option form) where `<target>`
   names a `.factory`-class path (bare `.factory`, `./.factory`, absolute or relative forms ending
   in `/.factory`, matched case-insensitively), the plugin MUST perform branch detection against
   the TARGET directory by executing `git -C <target> branch --show-current` (via
   `host::exec_subprocess`), rather than relying solely on CWD-based detection:
   - Target branch is a product branch → **BLOCK** with `FactoryPathOnProductBranch` (PC1).
   - Target branch is `factory-artifacts` → **PASS** unconditionally (PC3). This is the
     state-manager's canonical mounted-worktree workflow: `git -C .factory add ...` on the
     `factory-artifacts` worktree MUST NOT be blocked.
   - Target branch detection fails (non-zero exit, empty output, or git unavailable) →
     **fail-open** with advisory warning, per Invariant 3 semantics.

   **Human authorization:** human gate decision 2026-07-23 (S-21.01 pass-5 F-P5-001
   "Fix: target-aware detection").

   **Accepted Residuals (S-21.01 pass-6/7; documentary-only; no behavioral requirement
   changes):**
   1. **Trailing-slash `-C .factory/` target form not classified factory-class.** Invariant 6's
      enumeration of `.factory`-class paths (bare `.factory`, `./.factory`, absolute/relative
      forms ending in `/.factory`) deliberately omits the trailing-slash variant
      (e.g., `-C .factory/`). Consequence: a command using the trailing-slash form falls through
      to CWD-based detection rather than target-aware detection, producing a rare OVER-block
      (conservative direction) on a mounted `factory-artifacts` worktree when the operator uses
      a non-canonical trailing-slash path. Conservative direction — accepted. (S-21.01 pass-6
      sub-NITPICK.)
   2. **Single-detection-first-target semantics (chained payload under-match).** The guard
      performs at most ONE `host::exec_subprocess` invocation for target branch detection per
      payload (single-invocation constraint). A chained payload with a benign-first and a
      dangerous-second factory-class target — e.g.,
      `git -C .factory add x && git -C /other/.factory add y` — is under-matched on the second
      target. Accepted: faithful to Invariant 6's singular-target contract; near-zero realism
      (requires two distinct `.factory` mounts in the same payload); outside issue #342's threat
      model; Precondition 4 neutralizes single-mount variants. (S-21.01 pass-7 NITPICK.)

## SDK Grounding Evidence

**Grep 1 — WASM crate stub location (to be created by S-21.01):**
```
ls crates/hook-plugins/validate-factory-path-staging/ 2>/dev/null || echo "PLANNED — not yet created"
```
Expected: "PLANNED — not yet created" at authoring time; crate created by S-21.01 implementation.

**Grep 2 — factory-branch-guard.sh scope (does NOT guard Bash `git add` or `git stage`):**
```
grep -n "git add" plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/factory-branch-guard.sh
```
Expected: one comment-line hit — line 15: `#   state-manager commits: Bash tool for git add/commit in .factory/`.
This is a descriptive comment, not an interception pattern. The conclusion holds: factory-branch-guard.sh
contains no `git add` or `git stage` interception logic. The gap this BC closes is confirmed by the
absence of any blocking pattern (conditional branch, exit call, or intercept logic) keyed on a
`git add` or `git stage` match — NOT by zero grep hits. The comment's presence confirms the author
was aware of the `git add` surface; the absence of a guard pattern confirms it was left unguarded.
(`git stage` is an alias pointing to the same git plumbing — the same analysis applies.)

**Grep 3 — hooks-registry.toml entry for validate-factory-path-staging:**
```
grep -n "validate-factory-path-staging" plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks-registry.toml
```
Expected: entry present (added by S-21.01) or absent before implementation.

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| (TBD — to be assigned by state-manager after VP authoring pass) | Block fires on `git add`/`git stage` of `.factory/X` when branch != `factory-artifacts` | bats: invoke guard with mocked branch=develop; payload=`git add .factory/STATE.md`; assert exit 2 + `FactoryPathOnProductBranch` |
| (TBD) | Pass unconditionally when branch == `factory-artifacts` | bats: invoke guard with branch=factory-artifacts; payload=`git add .factory/STATE.md`; assert exit 0 |
| (TBD) | Fail-open on crash | unit: force panic in guard body; assert dispatcher continues with `block_intent=false` |
| (TBD) | Path-pattern coverage: proptest | proptest: fuzz .factory/ path variants (with components, root-relative, abs path); assert block fires on all |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | CAP-034 |
| Capability Anchor Justification | CAP-034 (Nested Worktree Path Exclusivity) per ARCH-INDEX v3.07 / ADR-031 §Decision 3. This BC is the primary enforcement mechanism for CAP-034's invariant layer: the `validate-factory-path-staging` WASM guard blocks the `git add`/`git stage` surface that creates the dual-tracking condition. BC-5.43.001 is the safety-net layer of the same CAP-034 capability. |
| L2 Domain Invariants | none (operational infrastructure) |
| Architecture Module | `crates/hook-plugins/validate-factory-path-staging/` (new crate; to be created by S-21.01; ADR-031 §Decision 3 naming authority) |
| Stories | S-21.01 (E-21 Wave 1) |
| Source Issues | #342 (product-branch merge silently rm's a `.factory/` file) |
| ADR Reference | ADR-031 §Decision 3 (authoritative crate naming: `validate-factory-path-staging.wasm`; `crates/hook-plugins/validate-artifact-path/` serves BC-4.11.001 Edit/Write/MultiEdit path validation since S-13.01 and cannot be reused — registry filename + cargo output collisions) |

## Related BCs

- BC-4.13.001 — sibling guard on same SS-04 surface; governs Edit/Write/MultiEdit/Agent lock enforcement; orthogonal (different tool surface, different invariant)
- BC-4.11.001 — the existing BC that owns `crates/hook-plugins/validate-artifact-path/` (Edit/Write/MultiEdit path validation since S-13.01); NOT the same crate as this BC; naming distinction enforced by ADR-031 §Decision 3
- BC-5.43.001 — safety-net layer companion; governs orchestrator pre-merge intersection check that defends against dual-tracking even if this guard was bypassed (issue #342 defense-in-depth)

## Architecture Anchors

- `crates/hook-plugins/validate-factory-path-staging/` — WASM plugin source (new crate; to be created by S-21.01; ADR-031 §Decision 3 naming authority)
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks-registry.toml` — registry entry for `validate-factory-path-staging` (to be added by S-21.01)
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/factory-branch-guard.sh` — existing guard that covers Edit/Write surface but NOT Bash `git add`/`git stage`; grandfathered per E-20 scope; this BC closes the `git add`/`git stage` gap without touching that script

## Story Anchor

S-21.01 (E-21 Wave 1 — factory artifact path guard: prevent dual-tracking and intercept product-branch merges that would clobber `.factory/` paths)

## VP Anchors

TBD — VP IDs to be assigned after VP authoring pass.

|---------|------|-------------|
| 1.8 | 2026-07-23 | POL-14 auto-promotion at merge (state-manager; S-21.01 PR #759 squash-merged 7bb0e797 2026-07-23). lifecycle_status draft→active. BC-INDEX v4.19→v4.20. |
| 1.7 | 2026-07-23 | Accepted Residuals record (product-owner; S-21.01 pass-6/7 adversarial cascade; documentary-only — no behavioral requirement changes). Two accepted residuals recorded in Invariant 6: (1) trailing-slash `-C .factory/` target forms not classified factory-class (Invariant 6 enumeration omits trailing-slash variant) — consequence is rare OVER-block via CWD fallback on mounted worktrees with non-canonical trailing-slash form; conservative direction, accepted (S-21.01 pass-6 sub-NITPICK); (2) single-detection-first-target semantics: guard performs at most ONE target branch detection per payload (`exec_subprocess` single-invocation constraint); chained payload with benign-first + dangerous-second factory-class target (`git -C .factory add x && git -C /other/.factory add y`) under-matched on second target; accepted: faithful to Invariant 6 singular-target contract, near-zero realism (requires two distinct `.factory` mounts), outside issue #342 threat model, Precondition 4 neutralizes single-mount variants (S-21.01 pass-7 NITPICK). BC-INDEX v4.18→v4.19. |
| 1.6 | 2026-07-23 | F-P5-001 spec-tightening amendment (product-owner; S-21.01 LOCAL cascade pass 5; human gate decision 2026-07-23). F-P5-001 [LOW][spec-gap]: Target-aware branch detection for `-C` and `-c core.worktree=` forms — when a consumed `-C <target>` or `-c core.worktree=<target>` value names a `.factory`-class path, branch detection MUST run against the target directory (`git -C <target> branch --show-current`); product branch → BLOCK; `factory-artifacts` → PASS (state-manager mounted-worktree canonical); detection failure → fail-open per Invariant 3. Invariant 6 added. Precondition 2 note added (target INSPECTION of already-consumed values, not re-classification as arguments). §Description extended with target-aware detection behavior. EC-012 (`git -C .factory add` on unmounted develop → BLOCKED), EC-013 (mounted factory-artifacts → PASSED), EC-014 (`-c core.worktree=.factory` on develop → BLOCKED) added. T-7/T-8/T-9 added. Sub-NITPICK: dedicated test for `--super-prefix` value-consuming option deferred to test-writer. BC-INDEX v4.17→v4.18. |
| 1.5 | 2026-07-22 | F-P4-001 + F-P4-002 spec-tightening amendments (product-owner; S-21.01 LOCAL cascade pass 4). F-P4-001 [MEDIUM]: Precondition 2 detection contract made class-complete — detector MUST consume the value token of every value-consuming git global option before selecting the subcommand token; canonical value-consuming set enumerated (`-C`, `-c`, `--git-dir`, `--work-tree`, `--namespace`, `--super-prefix`, `--exec-path` when space-separated; `=`-joined forms self-contained); conservative rule for UNKNOWN dash-prefix tokens: treat as non-value-consuming, any subsequent standalone `add`/`stage` in same command segment triggers detection (under-match forbidden; conservative over-match acceptable). F-P4-002 [LOW]: candidate `git` tokens glued to leading shell punctuation (`$(git`, `(git`, backtick-git) — detection strips leading shell punctuation from candidate tokens (conservative). §Description + PC4 sibling-site sweep (TD-VSDD-060). BC-INDEX v4.16→v4.17. |
| 1.4 | 2026-07-22 | F-P2-002 + F-P2-003 spec-tightening amendments (product-owner; S-21.01 LOCAL cascade pass 2). Precondition 2 detection contract expanded: behavioral contract stated as "any token sequence beginning `git` whose first non-option subcommand token is `add` or `stage`, tolerating any number of intervening global options or flags"; covers `git -C <path> add`, `git --no-pager add`, `git -c key=val add` (Layer-1 bypasses via common invocations); minimum form `git\s+(add\|stage)` retained; chained-command-form applicability made explicit (`&&`, `;`, pipe). Invariant 4: `.factory` path detection is case-insensitive (conservative blocking on case-folding filesystems: macOS HFS+, Windows NTFS — e.g., `.Factory/STATE.md` matches). §Description + PC4 sibling-site sweep (TD-VSDD-060). BC-INDEX v4.15→v4.16. |
| 1.3 | 2026-07-22 | F-P1-003 + F-P1-001 spec-tightening amendments (product-owner; S-21.01 LOCAL cascade pass 1). Precondition 2 matcher extended `git\s+add` to `git\s+(add\|stage)` to cover `git stage` (true git synonym; same dual-tracking vector) per ADR-031 §Decision 2 Layer-1. Invariant 4 conservative-blocking enumeration extended with bare `.factory` (no trailing slash), `./` (CWD-relative with explicit slash), and `:/`-family pathspec-magic arguments alongside existing `-A`/`--all`/`-u`/`--update`/`.`/glob forms. H1 title + §Description + PC4 + EC-009 sibling-site sweep (TD-VSDD-060). BC-INDEX v4.14→v4.15. |
| 1.2 | 2026-07-19 | Research validation precision amendments (product-owner; research validation 2026-07-19). SDK Grounding Evidence Grep 2 expected-output corrected: grep hits line 15 comment (not zero hits); conclusion reworded to derive from absence of intercept pattern, not zero hits. Precondition 4 added: environmental scope note (mounted-worktree silent-no-op behavior; guard primary protective value on unmounted checkouts — CI, clone, pre-mount commits). |
| 1.1 | 2026-07-19 | CAP-034 backfill + crate name correction (product-owner; ADR-031 §Decision 3). All 10 occurrences of wrong crate name `validate-artifact-path` replaced with `validate-factory-path-staging` (TD-VSDD-060 sibling-site sweep: H1 title, §Description ×2, Precondition 3, Invariant 2/4 ×2, SDK Grounding Evidence Grep 1/3, §Traceability Architecture Module, §Architecture Anchors ×2). §Traceability ADR Reference row added. §Traceability Capability Anchor Justification updated to cite CAP-034 / ARCH-INDEX v3.07 / ADR-031 §Decision 3. §Related BCs: BC-4.11.001 note added clarifying `validate-artifact-path` crate ownership. |
| 1.0 | 2026-07-19 | Initial authoring (product-owner; E-21 factory-state data-loss hardening; issue #342). validate-factory-path-staging WASM PreToolUse Bash guard — block `git add` of `.factory/` paths on product branches (PC1), pass all other commands (PC2/PC3/PC4). INV-E21-001 instantiation (invariant layer). 4 error variants: `FactoryPathOnProductBranch` (PC1), fail-open (Invariants 2/3). 10 edge cases EC-001..EC-010. 6 canonical test vectors T-1..T-6. lifecycle_status: draft (POL-14 auto-promotion on S-21.01 PR merge). |
