# Behavioral Contract BC-4.01.002: legacy-bash-adapter strips plugin_config to Null before piping payload to bash

## Description

The `legacy-bash-adapter` clones the incoming payload, sets `plugin_config = Null`, and only then serializes the payload bytes to pipe to bash. Bash hooks predate the `plugin_config` field and must not see it.

## Preconditions

1. The adapter has resolved `plugin_config` and is about to call `run_bash`.

## Postconditions

1. The re-serialized payload sent to the bash hook has `plugin_config: null`.
2. The adapter's local `payload.plugin_config` value is preserved on the adapter's stack but never reaches bash.

## Invariants

1. Bash hooks never observe `plugin_config` populated values.

## Edge Cases

| ID | Description | Expected Behavior |
|----|-------------|-------------------|
| EC-001 | (No edge cases captured in Phase 0 extraction; to be added in Phase 1.5/test-writer pass) | TBD |

## Canonical Test Vectors

| Input | Expected Output | Category |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Payload with non-null plugin_config; adapter pipes to bash | bytes piped to bash parse as JSON with `plugin_config: null` | happy-path |
| TBD | TBD | edge-case |
| TBD | TBD | error |

## Verification Properties

| VP-NNN | Property | Proof Method |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| (TBD — to be assigned in Phase 1.6b) | | |

## Traceability

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| L2 Capability | TBD (anchor in Phase 1.5) |
| L2 Domain Invariants | TBD |
| Architecture Module | SS-04 — `crates/hook-plugins/legacy-bash-adapter/src/lib.rs` (`adapter_logic`) |
| Stories | TBD (re-anchor in Phase 1.8 from S-N.MM stories) |

### Source Evidence

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Path** | `crates/hook-plugins/legacy-bash-adapter/src/lib.rs` (`adapter_logic`) |
| **Confidence** | HIGH |
| **Extraction Date** | 2026-04-25 |
| **Extracted from** | `.factory/phase-0-ingestion/pass-3-behavioral-contracts.md` line `368` |

#### Evidence Types Used

- assertion (clone + set Null + serialize)

#### Purity Classification

| Property | Assessment |
|----------|-----------|
| **I/O operations** | TBD (Phase 1.6b will refine) |
| **Global state access** | TBD |
| **Deterministic** | TBD |
| **Thread safety** | TBD |
| **Overall classification** | TBD |

#### Refactoring Notes

(TBD — to be assessed in Phase 1.6b verification properties pass)
