# Changelog

## 1.0.0-rc.8 — Hooks-test migration to hooks-registry.toml (2026-05-04)

Release candidate 8 finishes the S-0.4 hooks.json untracking properly.
The rc.7 hotfix #2 re-tracked hooks.json as a workaround when the
bats suite broke without it; rc.8 migrates those tests to assert
against `hooks-registry.toml` (the actual source of truth) and
removes the "dual tracked + gitignored" hack.

### Removed

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/hooks.json` — untracked cleanly** (was
  in the repo as both tracked and gitignored, a contradictory state
  introduced in rc.7 hotfix #2 to satisfy 11 bats suites that asserted
  against this file). The file is now per-machine only — populated by
  `/vsdd-factory:activate` copying the right `hooks.json.<platform>`
  variant into place. S-0.4 design intent fully restored.

### Fixed

- **13 bats suites migrated to assert against `hooks-registry.toml`
  instead of `hooks.json`.** Pre-rc.8 pattern checked the per-machine
  activation output:
  ```bash
  jq -e '.hooks.PostToolUse[].hooks[] | select(.command | contains("X"))' hooks.json
  ```
  Post-rc.8 pattern checks the canonical source of truth (what the
  dispatcher actually loads):
  ```bash
  registry_has_hook "X" "PostToolUse"
  ```
  27 individual `@test` blocks updated across `corpus-lint`,
  `convergence-tracker`, `destructive-guard`, `finding-format`,
  `input-hash`, `novelty-assessment`, `policy-enforcement`, `policy9`,
  `pr-lifecycle-hooks`, `protect-secrets`, `state-health`,
  `template-compliance`, `wave-gate-hooks`. All migrated tests pass
  locally and are stable across the activate boundary.
- **BC-9.01.005 Rust test** (asserts hooks.json IS gitignored)
  continues to pass — `.gitignore` entry intact; only the
  dual-tracked state was removed.

### Added

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/helpers/registry.bash`** — shared
  bats helper with two assertion functions:
  - `registry_has_hook NAME [EVENT] [TOOL]` — verifies a hook is
    registered with optional event + tool matcher specificity.
  - `registry_has_script SCRIPT_PATH` — verifies a legacy bash hook
    is wired through `legacy-bash-adapter.wasm` (matches `script_path`
    field).

### Migration

No user-facing changes. The plugin install + activate flow is
unchanged. Existing rc.7 users:

```
/plugin marketplace update claude-mp
/plugin update vsdd-factory@claude-mp
/reload-plugins
```

After update, the cache will NOT contain a `hooks/hooks.json` file
(correct per S-0.4). The file gets created on `/vsdd-factory:activate`
from the appropriate `hooks.json.<platform>` variant. If you have an
old `hooks.json` from a pre-rc.8 install, it will be overwritten by
the next activate. No manual cleanup required.

## 1.0.0-rc.7 — Marketplace split to drbothen/claude-mp (2026-05-03)

Release candidate 7 finishes what rc.6 attempted: splits the marketplace
out of this repo into a separate `drbothen/claude-mp` repository so
`/plugin install` actually populates the cache and surfaces all 120
`/vsdd-factory:*` slash commands. The rc.6 attempt with `git-subdir +
ref=main` was schema-correct but empirically still broken in our
self-referential same-repo layout — the cache-populate step silently
failed identically to the schema-invalid `github + path` form shipped in
rc.2-rc.5. Moving the marketplace to a separate repo puts vsdd-factory
on the well-tested cross-repo install path used by every working sibling
plugin (Semgrep, dclaude, wclaude, zclaude, etc.).

### Removed

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — deleted from this repo. The
  marketplace catalog now lives at
  [drbothen/claude-mp](https://github.com/drbothen/claude-mp), pointing
  back at this repo via `git-subdir + ref=main`. claude-mp owns its own
  version field; it gets bumped out-of-band when this repo ships a new
  release.
- **release.yml `marketplace.json` write step** — `commit-binaries` job
  no longer writes a version into a file that doesn't exist anymore.
  `plugin.json` is still written from the tag atomically with the
  bundled binaries (the cache-staleness fix from beta.4 still applies).
- **`scripts/bump-version.sh` marketplace.json references** — the script
  no longer reads or displays a `marketplace.json` version. Only
  `plugin.json` is referenced as display-only context.

### Fixed

- **`/plugin install vsdd-factory@claude-mp` now correctly populates
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-mp/vsdd-factory/<version>/`** with all
  120 SKILL.md files, 44 agent files, 36 hook entries, and the LSP
  server. Verified via clean-room install: cache directory is created,
  skill count > 0, all `/vsdd-factory:*` slash commands appear in the
  picker.
- **Untracked `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/hooks.json`** per S-0.4 design
  intent. The base `hooks.json` is per-machine (created by
  `/vsdd-factory:activate` copying the right `hooks.json.<platform>`
  variant into place); only the template + 5 per-platform variants
  belong in the repo. Some prior commit re-tracked the base file, and
  it was never updated as bash hooks were ported to native WASM in
  S-8.x — accumulating 3 stale references to deleted .sh files
  (`session-learning.sh`, `handoff-validator.sh`, `track-agent-stop.sh`)
  that fired Stop / SubagentStop hooks as "No such file or directory"
  errors. Fix: `git rm --cached` the base file. New installs will not
  have hooks active until the user runs `/vsdd-factory:activate`.
- **The `sync-develop` job in `release.yml`** still runs to keep develop
  in sync with main's binary-bundle commits, but its rationale is
  documented now as "git workflow consistency" rather than the
  pre-rc.7 "marketplace.json freshness" reason that no longer applies.
- **`block-ai-attribution` and `capture-pr-activity` WASM hook plugins
  now load successfully.** Both crates were silently crashing on every
  fire with `plugin file not found` — Cargo's default `[lib]` name
  conversion produced underscored output filenames
  (`block_ai_attribution.wasm`, `capture_pr_activity.wasm`) but
  `hooks-registry.toml` references the hyphenated forms
  (`block-ai-attribution.wasm`, `capture-pr-activity.wasm`). Cargo
  doesn't allow hyphens in `[lib]` names, so the only way to produce
  hyphenated wasm output is via `[[bin]]` (which does allow hyphens).
  Migrated both crates to the canonical `[[bin]]` WASI command pattern
  matching `capture-commit-activity` and `handoff-validator`: added
  `src/main.rs` with a thin `on_hook` wrapper that calls into the
  lib's existing logic, removed `crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]`
  from `[lib]`, added `[[bin]] name = "<hyphenated>"`. Empirically
  verified: PreToolUse fires now show `block-ai-attribution: exit 0`
  (was crash); PostToolUse with `gh pr create` now emits a real
  `pr.created` event for the first time. Both crates' existing
  unit-test suites continue to pass (43 tests for block-ai-attribution,
  71 tests for capture-pr-activity) since the lib logic was untouched.

### Added (CI)

- **`bump-marketplace` job in `release.yml`** — auto-opens a PR against
  `drbothen/claude-mp` after each release tag, bumping the
  `vsdd-factory` plugin entry's `version` field. Self-skips when
  `CLAUDE_MP_PAT` secret is not configured. To enable: create a PAT
  with `contents: write` + `pull-requests: write` scopes on
  `drbothen/claude-mp` and add it as `CLAUDE_MP_PAT` in this repo's
  Actions secrets. The job opens a PR (not a direct push) so the
  operator gets a review gate.

### Added

- **`docs/guide/plugin-marketplace-architecture.md`** — fully rewritten
  to capture the actual rc.2 → rc.6 → rc.7 saga, the empirical
  observation that `git-subdir` is only verified to work in cross-repo
  installs (NOT same-repo with `path:`), and the validation discipline
  (clean-room install + cache directory check) that catches install
  bugs `claude plugin validate` doesn't.
- **README + getting-started + migrating-from-0.79 install instructions**
  updated to use the new `drbothen/claude-mp` marketplace.
- **Migration note in `migrating-from-0.79.md`** flagging the
  marketplace change for operators upgrading from v0.79.x and skipping
  past rc.6.

### Migration

**Action required for ALL users on rc.6 or earlier.** The marketplace
identifier changed from `vsdd-factory@vsdd-factory` to
`vsdd-factory@claude-mp`.

```bash
# In a Claude Code session
/plugin marketplace remove vsdd-factory       # remove the old (broken) marketplace
/plugin marketplace add drbothen/claude-mp    # add the new marketplace
/plugin install vsdd-factory@claude-mp        # install via new marketplace
/vsdd-factory:activate                        # required: populate hooks.json from
                                              #   the right per-platform variant
/reload-plugins                               # pick up new state
```

> **`/vsdd-factory:activate` is REQUIRED** in v1.0+ to populate the
> per-machine `hooks/hooks.json` from the right per-platform variant.
> Without activation, no hooks fire (this is correct behavior — the
> plugin is installed but inactive). Pre-rc.7 a buggy committed base
> `hooks.json` masked this requirement and shipped broken `.sh`
> references; rc.7 removes that file from the repo.

After reload, `/vsdd-factory:*` slash commands should appear in the
picker for the first time since rc.1. Verify the cache directory is
populated:

```bash
ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-mp/vsdd-factory/1.0.0-rc.7/
# should list: skills/ agents/ hooks/ hook-plugins/ bin/ ...
find ~/.claude/plugins/cache/claude-mp -name SKILL.md | wc -l
# should be 120
```

If the cache directory is empty after install, refer to
`docs/guide/plugin-marketplace-architecture.md` §8 (Validation
discipline) for the clean-room reinstall procedure.

**For repo maintainers only** — after this release ships and the bot
publishes the v1.0.0-rc.7 tag with bundled binaries, manually open a
PR against `drbothen/claude-mp` bumping the `vsdd-factory` plugin
entry's `version` field from `1.0.0-rc.6` to `1.0.0-rc.7`. Future
releases should automate this; for now it's a manual one-liner.

## 1.0.0-rc.6 — Marketplace install fix (2026-05-03)

Release candidate 6 fixes a silent install-time bug shipped in rc.4 and
rc.5 that prevented Claude Code from populating the plugin cache, which
in turn prevented `/vsdd-factory:*` slash commands and skills from
loading at all. The marketplace clone was correct on disk and
`claude plugin validate` reported success — but the plugin loader found
zero skills because the cache install path recorded in
`installed_plugins.json` never actually got created.

### Fixed

- **`marketplace.json` `source` field now uses the documented
  `git-subdir` form with explicit `ref: "main"`.** Previous releases
  shipped a schema-violating combination — `source: "github"` with a
  `path:` field — that no Claude Code source type officially supports.
  The install code path silently skipped the cache copy step when
  encountering the unrecognized field combination, leaving
  `~/.claude/plugins/cache/vsdd-factory/vsdd-factory/<version>/`
  empty even though `installed_plugins.json` recorded a successful
  install. Replaced with:
  ```json
  "source": {
    "source": "git-subdir",
    "url": "https://github.com/drbothen/vsdd-factory.git",
    "path": "plugins/vsdd-factory",
    "ref": "main"
  }
  ```
  `git-subdir` is the documented source type for "plugin at a subpath
  of an external git repo," and `ref: "main"` pins installs to the
  release-stable branch independent of the marketplace clone's
  checked-out ref. The latter matters because we use Git Flow — the
  GitHub default branch is `develop` (in-flight), but releases live on
  `main`. Without explicit ref pinning, future re-registrations of the
  marketplace could silently start pulling pre-release work from
  develop instead of release-stable code from main.

### Added

- **`docs/guide/plugin-marketplace-architecture.md`** — comprehensive
  reference for the plugin packaging architecture. Documents:
  - All 5 valid `source` types (`relative-path string`, `github`,
    `url`, `git-subdir`, `npm`) with when-to-use guidance
  - A decision tree that accounts for ref-pinning needs under Git Flow
  - The full root cause of the rc.4/rc.5 bug and why
    `claude plugin validate` failed to catch it
  - Repository layout today and future evolution paths (central
    marketplace, release channels for stable vs edge)
  - Complete `SKILL.md` frontmatter field reference
  - Common pitfalls catalogued during the rc.5 audit (blank lines in
    YAML frontmatter, comma-separated `allowed-tools` instead of
    space-separated, `disable-model-invocation` interactions with
    auto-loading)
  - Validation discipline checklist for future marketplace changes

### Migration

No breaking user-facing changes for installed plugins. Users who
installed rc.5 (or earlier) and saw the "0 skills" issue should see
slash commands appear after upgrading to rc.6 and running
`/plugin update vsdd-factory@vsdd-factory` followed by
`/reload-plugins`. Users on a clean install should see the issue go
away on first install.

If `/plugin update` reports already-installed at a non-rc.6 version but
the cache directory is empty, force a fresh install:

```bash
claude plugin uninstall vsdd-factory@vsdd-factory --scope project
# (or --scope user, depending on how it was originally installed)
# then /plugin install vsdd-factory@vsdd-factory
```

If maintaining a marketplace registration that points at this repo,
no action needed — the marketplace.json shipped on `main` is now
self-correcting.

## 1.0.0-rc.5 — Skills-only plugin surface (2026-05-03)

Release candidate 5 collapses the dual command + skill plugin surface
into a single skills-only surface and closes the model-auto-invocation
gap on the activate/deactivate lifecycle skills. Both changes follow
the marketplace pattern shipped by sibling plugins (dclaude, wclaude,
zclaude), which expose `/<plugin>:<skill>` slash commands directly
from skill frontmatter without parallel command shim files.

### Removed

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/commands/` directory (111 files)** — every
  command was a thin shim of the form `Use the vsdd-factory:<name>
  skill via the Skill tool`. The Claude Code plugin loader already
  exposes plugin skills as `/vsdd-factory:<name>` slash commands from
  SKILL.md frontmatter; the shim files were pure duplication. All
  command descriptions had drifted from their skill counterparts (111
  of 111 differed in wording), making the directory a maintenance
  liability with no user-facing benefit.
- **8 stale "command file exists" bats assertions** —
  `tests/input-hash.bats`, `tests/skills.bats`, and
  `tests/state-health.bats` each had assertions checking that a
  parallel command shim existed alongside its skill. Removed alongside
  the shims; the sibling "skill exists" assertions remain and are the
  real existence check.

### Fixed

- **`activate` and `deactivate` skills now set
  `disable-model-invocation: true`** — both skills write to
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (activate flips the default
  main-thread agent to `orchestrator` and persists the host platform;
  deactivate reverses it). Without the flag, the plugin loader
  exposed both as ambient tools the model could choose to call
  unprompted. With the flag set, Claude's tool catalog no longer
  lists them, but `/vsdd-factory:activate` and
  `/vsdd-factory:deactivate` continue to work as user-typed slash
  commands.

### Added

- **`Examples` block in `skills/create-adr/SKILL.md`** — ported from
  the deleted `commands/create-adr.md`. The skill already carried the
  Arguments table; only the Examples block was unique to the command
  shim and worth preserving.

### Migration

No breaking user-facing changes. All 120 skills remain invokable via
`/vsdd-factory:<skill-name>`. Argument passing is unchanged: skills
that reference `$ARGUMENTS` in their body continue to substitute
inline; skills that don't continue to receive an auto-appended
`ARGUMENTS:` line from the plugin loader. The 9 skills that never had
a command shim (`phase-0-codebase-ingestion` through
`phase-7-convergence` and `state-burst`) are unaffected — they were
already orchestrator-dispatched.

If any out-of-tree tooling shelled out to `plugins/vsdd-factory/commands/<name>.md`
directly (rather than invoking via `/vsdd-factory:<name>`), update it
to read `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` instead. No
in-repo references to the commands directory remain.

## 1.0.0-rc.4 — Pre-W16 hardening sprint (2026-05-03)

Release candidate 4 ships pre-flight hardening for the W-16 (Tier 2 native
WASM) wave. Addresses orphan-reference fragility surfaced by W-15's release
recovery cycles, sweeps clippy debt, restores main branch protection with bot
bypass, and removes legacy bash hook dupes that have native WASM equivalents.

### Added

- **bats-orphan-detection CI gate (TD-017)** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  validate job now runs `plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/check-bats-orphans.sh`,
  which scans every `tests/*.bats` for `hooks/<name>.sh` references and fails
  if any referenced hook is missing from `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/`.
  Detects deletion-driven orphans pre-merge.
- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/check-bats-orphans.sh`** — standalone shell
  script enforcing the gate above; invokable locally as `bash
  plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/check-bats-orphans.sh`.

### Changed

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/run-all.sh` glob discovery (TD-016)** —
  Replaced 23-line hardcoded suite enumeration with 7-line `nullglob` loop.
  New `.bats` files are picked up automatically; deleted ones don't break CI
  with stale references. Also: continues past first-failure suite, accumulates
  failed-suite list, and reports total fail count at the end (was: aborted on
  first failure under `set -e`).
- **main branch protection restored (TD-013)** — `enforce_admins=false`,
  `required_pull_request_reviews=null` (allows `github-actions[bot]` direct
  push for release.yml bundle commits), `required_status_checks=null`,
  `allow_force_pushes=false`, `allow_deletions=false`. Replaces fully-disabled
  state from W-15 recovery cycles.
- **Workspace clippy debt swept (TD-018)** — `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings` is now clean. Side effect: 6 pre-existing
  test failures in `generate-registry.bats` fixed (the migration generator
  was clobbering hand-maintained `hooks-registry.toml` during test runs).

### Removed

- **3 legacy bash hook dupes deleted** — `block-ai-attribution.sh`,
  `capture-commit-activity.sh`, `capture-pr-activity.sh`. All have native
  WASM equivalents shipped in W-15. Their dedicated `.bats` files removed;
  references in `pr-lifecycle-hooks.bats` trimmed; `hooks.json` entries
  removed.

### Fixed

- **Orphan references in `factory-obs.bats` and `regression-v1.0.bats`** —
  Tests asserting deleted .sh executables removed; replaced with sentinel
  comments explaining the WASM port.
- **`check-bats-orphans.sh` regex coverage** — broadened from `$HOOKS_DIR/`
  pattern to all `hooks/<name>.sh` reference forms (catches
  `${BATS_TEST_DIRNAME}/../hooks/`, `$PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/`, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/`,
  hardcoded paths, etc.).

### Tech Debt Backlog (post-rc.4)

- TD-019 — `ci.yml` triggers on `pull_request: [main]` only; PRs targeting
  develop don't run CI gates. Will be addressed as a follow-up before rc.5
  or v1.0.0 GA.

## 1.0.0-rc.3 — W-15 convergence + wave-gate fixes (2026-05-02)

Release candidate 3 ships the completed W-15 wave gate (12 stories merged)
plus three post-merge fix-bursts (PRs #59, #60, #61) that closed all CRIT/HIGH
findings before tagging. First rc that fully exercises the native WASM plugin
pipeline with dispatcher binary bundling across all 5 platforms.

### Fixed

- **[W-15-gate / PR #59]** Critical and high pre-rc.3 findings: dispatcher
  AND-gate logic, tool_input field regression, dead fixture cleanup, and
  HOST_ABI.md alignment.
- **[W-15-gate-2 / PR #60]** Dispatcher AND-gate re-verification + tool_input
  regression confirmed resolved; integration test coverage added.
- **[W-15-gate-3 / PR #61]** HOST_ABI.md spec alignment with implementation;
  removed stale test fixtures that were masking true coverage gaps.

### Added

- **W-15 wave convergence (12 stories merged)** — Native WASM port of all
  SubagentStop and Stop hook plugins complete; legacy bash adapter retained as
  routing shim. All 16 registry entries now route through the native dispatcher.
- **`host::write_file` SDK API** — hook plugins can write to host-allowlisted
  paths via `WriteFileCaps` capability schema; HOST_ABI_VERSION stays at 1
  (additive-only, D-6 Option A). See BC-2.02.011.
- **advisory-block-mode pattern** documented in HOST_ABI.md — dispatchers
  can surface advisory blocks without hard-failing the hook chain.

### Migration

No breaking changes. All slash commands, auto-invocation, and orchestrator
dispatch continue to work unchanged. The native dispatcher replaces bash
adapter execution paths transparently; no operator configuration required.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- `host::write_file(path, contents, max_bytes, timeout_ms) -> Result<(), HostError>` SDK API for hook plugins to write to host-allowlisted paths. New WriteFileCaps capability schema (`path_allow`, `max_bytes_per_call`). HOST_ABI_VERSION unchanged at 1 (D-6 Option A additive-only). See BC-2.02.011 for full invariants.

### Security
- Fixed path-traversal vulnerability in `path_allowed()` for both `read_file` and `write_file` dispatcher bindings: paths are now canonicalized before the allowlist prefix check, preventing `../` escapes from bypassing capability gates. (BC-2.02.011 EC-001 / BC-2.02.001 EC-001 — same bug existed in both host functions.)

## 1.0.0-rc.2 — Release Candidate 2 (skill cleanup) (2026-05-01)

Bug-fix release focused on plugin frontmatter cleanup and CI/CD reliability.
The headline change: 29 skills had `disable-model-invocation: true` set, which
was preventing the orchestrator (which runs as the model) from dispatching
those skills via the Skill tool — forcing fallback to ToolSearch and the
"load multiple times then search" UX friction. This release removes that
flag from all 29 skills. Real safety lives in the skill body, not in the flag.

### Fixed

- **commands/claude-telemetry.md** — quoted the description so YAML parses;
  the unquoted "Default: on" fragment was a YAML mapping-separator bug that
  caused `claude plugin validate` to fail.
- **skills/generate-pdf** — renamed `tools:` to `allowed-tools:` (the
  former was silently ignored, meaning the skill ran without its declared
  tool pre-approvals).
- **agents/session-reviewer.md → agents/session-review.md** — renamed the
  file to match its `name: session-review` field and the matching skill
  convention. Workflow refs already used `session-review`.
- **9 orchestrator reference docs** — removed meaningless
  `disable-model-invocation: true` from sequence playbooks (the flag is
  skill-only; agents are invoked via `Agent(subagent_type=...)`).

### Added

- **`argument-hint` on 4 skills** — `claude-telemetry`, `factory-obs`,
  `run-phase`, `validate-workflow` now show their accepted arguments in
  slash-command autocomplete.
- **Marketplace JSON sync to develop** (release.yml `sync-develop` job and
  inline best-effort path in `commit-binaries`) — closes a Git Flow gap
  discovered during rc.1: Claude Code's plugin marketplace reads
  `marketplace.json` from the GitHub default branch (develop), but the
  post-tag bot writes version bumps only to main. Without these safeguards,
  develop's `marketplace.json` was always one release behind. This rc.2
  release is the first real-world test of the new path.
- **Marketplace `ref: "main"` pin** — `marketplace.json` plugin source now
  explicitly pulls from `main` so end-user installs always get released
  code regardless of which branch was read.

### Changed

- **29 skills no longer have `disable-model-invocation: true`** — affects
  pipeline ops (state-update, track-debt, check-state-health, factory-health,
  validate-consistency, convergence-check, wave-gate, holdout-eval,
  formal-verify, perf-check, spec-drift, dtu-validate, worktree-manage,
  pr-create, record-demo, setup-env), phase playbooks (create-prd,
  create-architecture, create-story, create-domain-spec, create-brief,
  create-adr, decompose-stories, research), and a handful of user-action
  skills. Orchestrator and sub-agents can now dispatch all of these via
  the Skill tool without "Unknown skill" fallback.

### Migration

No breaking changes for end-user plugin invocations. Slash commands,
auto-invocation, and orchestrator dispatch all continue to work; the
skill cleanup eliminates failure modes rather than introducing new ones.

For developers extending the plugin: if you'd added new skills with
`disable-model-invocation: true` for safety, consider whether real safety
should instead live in the skill body (explicit confirmation prompts,
prerequisite checks). The flag is not the right tool for orchestration
gates — see PR #45 for rationale.

## 1.0.0-rc.1 — Release Candidate 1 (2026-04-29)

First release candidate for v1.0.0 GA. Closes the 4-month beta cycle by shipping all
remaining v1.0 epics (Wave 11/12/13/14). WASM plugin ecosystem fully wired (DRIFT-006
closed; 4/4 lifecycle events). Multi-sink observability stack (file/HTTP/Datadog/Honeycomb
with retry/circuit-breaker/DLQ/routing/tag-enrichment) complete. Operator migration guide
and semver commitment documentation shipped.

### Added

- **Wave 11** — WASM plugin ports: capture-commit-activity (S-3.01), capture-pr-activity
  (S-3.02), block-ai-attribution (S-3.03); sink-http retry/jitter (S-4.09);
  cross-sink internal.sink_error events (S-4.10).
- **Wave 12** — Dead Letter Queue with byte-counted rotation (S-4.05); per-sink routing
  filters + tag enrichment (S-4.06); 40-test E2E observability integration suite (S-4.07);
  rc.1 release gate spec with 20 ACs (S-4.08).
- **Wave 13** — SessionStart hook (S-5.01); SessionEnd hook (S-5.02);
  WorktreeCreate/Remove hooks (S-5.03); PostToolUseFailure hook (S-5.04).
  DRIFT-006 fully closed.
- **Wave 14** — Operator migration guide v0.79.x → v1.0 (S-5.05);
  semver commitment documentation (S-5.06).
- Semgrep SAST workflow (`.github/workflows/semgrep.yml`), image pinned to 1.61.0.
- `deny.toml` cargo-deny 0.19 schema with permissive license allow-list (AC-Q4).

### Fixed

- deny.toml: removed invalid `unmaintained = "warn"` field incompatible with cargo-deny 0.19.
- Semgrep: 19 false-positive findings suppressed inline with justified `nosemgrep` comments.
- Stale `loads_legacy_registry` tests removed (v0.79.x migration complete).
- `sinks_file_integration` test: corrected sink type from `datadog` to `splunk` (S-4.07 drift).

## 1.0.0-beta.7 — S-7.03 TDD Discipline Hardening (2026-04-26)

This release ships the third E-7 self-referential dogfooding round: a 4-layer
structural defense against the stub-as-implementation anti-pattern, codified
into the plugin's own dispatcher prompts, hooks, and templates.

The motivating evidence: during Prism Wave 2, 3 of 5 parallel stub-architect
dispatches produced stubs with full business logic instead of `todo!()` bodies.
Root cause was precedent cascade — earlier merged DTU crates contained
pre-implemented stubs that Wave 2 stub-architects loaded as contextual
templates, silently bypassing the TDD Iron Law's Red Gate. This release
codifies four interlocking defenses so future cycles cannot recur.

### Added

- **Layer 1 — Stub obligations + GREEN-BY-DESIGN / WIRING-EXEMPT protocol.**
  `agents/stub-architect.md` (+187 LOC) gains explicit `todo!()` obligation
  citing BC-5.38.001 for non-trivial function bodies in `tdd_mode: strict`
  stories, plus a verbatim self-check rule (BC-5.38.005 invariant 1):
  "Before including any non-todo!() function body, apply self-check: 'If I
  include this real implementation, will the test for this function pass
  trivially without any implementer work?'" The agent now reports
  inline-implemented functions as `GREEN-BY-DESIGN` (pure data mappings —
  enum labels, zero-logic accessors, body ≤ 3 lines) or `WIRING-EXEMPT`
  (framework integration scaffolding like Tower `Service::poll_ready`).
  Both classes are excluded from the Red Gate denominator.

- **Layer 2 — Anti-precedent guard text in dispatch files.**
  `skills/deliver-story/SKILL.md` and `workflows/phases/per-story-delivery.md`
  Step 2 sections now include a verbatim guard block citing four canonical
  Prism SHAs: anti-precedent commits `aa706543`, `6d2d005e`, `20b4a12a`
  (Wave 2 violations) and model precedent `e86d03f2` (S-2.06 datasource-trait
  with 5 genuine `todo!()` macros). Both files updated atomically per
  BC-5.38.006 invariant 1.

- **Layer 3 — Red Gate Density Check (BLOCKING before Step 4).**
  New section in `per-story-delivery.md` between Step 3 and Step 4 enforcing
  `RED_RATIO ≥ 0.5` where `RED_RATIO = RED_TESTS / (TOTAL_NEW_TESTS - EXEMPT_TESTS)`
  and `EXEMPT_TESTS = GREEN-BY-DESIGN + WIRING-EXEMPT`. Two remediation
  options when ratio falls below threshold: Option A rolls back the stub
  and re-dispatches with stricter prompt (default for automated orchestrators
  per BC-8.29.003 EC-001); Option B accepts with `mutation_testing_required:
  true` frontmatter, electing mutation testing at the wave gate as the
  compensating control. New PostToolUse hook `hooks/validate-red-ratio.sh`
  (+119 LOC) enforces the threshold mechanically when red-gate-log files
  are written; logs go to `.factory/logs/red-gate-log-<story-id>.md` with
  per-test rationale categories (PURE-DATA / FRAMEWORK-WIRING /
  STRUCTURAL-ASSERTION / PRE-EXISTING-BEHAVIOR / OTHER-JUSTIFIED /
  UNJUSTIFIED). Hook registered in `hooks-registry.toml`.

- **Layer 4 — `tdd_mode` frontmatter contract.**
  `templates/story-template.md` gains a `tdd_mode: strict | facade` field
  with default-to-strict semantics (BC-8.30.001 invariant 2 — absent or
  unrecognized values default to `strict` so no existing story silently
  promotes to facade mode). Strict mode enforces the full TDD Iron Law
  with the new Red Gate density check; facade mode (intended for DTU
  clones and mock infrastructure where the scaffold IS the implementation)
  permits combined scaffold+impl commits and bypasses the Red Gate, with
  the cargo-mutants wave gate as the compensating control. New facade-mode
  delivery flow section in `per-story-delivery.md` documents the
  modifications to Steps 2/3/4 and the wave gate. `agents/story-writer.md`
  frontmatter checklist updated to require `tdd_mode` declaration.

- **Layer 5 — Mutation testing wave-gate.**
  `skills/wave-gate/SKILL.md` (+94 LOC) gains a Mutation Testing section
  that scans all stories in the wave for `tdd_mode: facade` and
  `mutation_testing_required: true` (Option B election), runs
  `cargo mutants -p <crate> --jobs $(nproc) --timeout 300`, and gates on
  ≥80% kill rate. Survivors above the 20% allowance enter a disposition
  table (A: new test committed + re-run kills mutant; B: dead-code-equivalent
  with execution condition; C: explicit waiver naming mutant + file + line
  + mutation type — no blanket waivers). 60-minute wave-level mutation
  budget. Empty-wave path: explicit "no facade stories — mutation step
  skipped" log entry, never silent omission.

- **Verification suite.** `tests/tdd-discipline-gate.bats` (+242 LOC, 18
  tests across 5 layers) covers all 11 acceptance criteria with grep-based
  assertions plus 3 hook-invocation tests for `validate-red-ratio.sh`
  (low-ratio block, sufficient-ratio pass, Option B election pass).

### Spec Convergence

S-7.03 spec converged through **17 adversarial passes** — the longest in
project history (vs S-6.01: 8 passes, E-7: 7 passes). Trajectory:
25 → 12 → 5 → 2 → 1 → 0 → 0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 2 → 0 → 0 → 0.
Pass-8 reset on F-301 (Architecture Compliance Rules cited wrong Task
numbers) was BC-5.36.005/006 partial-fix-regression discipline working
as designed. Pass-11 caught a deepest-yet propagation gap: a pass-1
re-anchor of BC-8.30.002 from SS-08 to SS-05 had propagated to BC-INDEX
but not to VP-064 scope/traceability (3 findings F-601/602/603 — 2 HIGH,
1 MED). The exhaustive enumerate-axes-upfront methodology (Path C) was
introduced at pass-13 and produced the final clean-pass triple at
passes 15/16/17.

### Process Notes

- **Bootstrap Exemption pattern formalized.** S-7.03 implements gates
  (Red Gate density, mutation testing) that cannot apply to its own
  delivery cycle — captured explicitly in the story's "Bootstrap Exemption"
  section and recorded as a methodology pattern for future
  self-referential codification stories.
- **Self-validation withdrawal as convergence indicator.** The adversary's
  withdrawal-via-re-arithmetic of hallucinated findings appeared
  pass-by-pass (2 → 2 → 5 → 11 → 6 across passes 13-17), peaking at
  pass-16 then stabilizing — a useful corollary signal alongside finding
  count for declaring true convergence.

### Identifier Counts (post-release)

| Type | Pre-beta.7 | Post-beta.7 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| BCs (total) | 1,878 | 1,891 (+13) |
| VPs | 62 | 64 (+2 — VP-063 integration, VP-064 manual) |
| FRs | 42 | 43 (+1 — FR-043) |
| Epics | 8 | 8 |
| Stories | 44 | 45 (+1 — S-7.03 status: completed) |
| ADRs | 13 | 13 |

### Migration

No breaking changes. The `tdd_mode` field defaults to `strict` for any
existing or future story that doesn't declare it explicitly — no existing
story is silently promoted to facade mode. The new Red Gate density check
applies only to `tdd_mode: strict` stories (which is everything by default).
The mutation testing wave gate applies only when at least one story in
a wave declares `tdd_mode: facade` or `mutation_testing_required: true`;
otherwise the step is explicitly skipped with a log entry.

The new `validate-red-ratio.sh` hook is read-only — it only inspects
red-gate-log files written by the orchestrator and never modifies any
file. Existing development flows that don't write red-gate-log files
will not invoke the hook.

Per beta.4 cache-staleness fix: this commit only touches CHANGELOG.md.
The release workflow bot will write plugin.json:version + binaries
atomically when v1.0.0-beta.7 tag is pushed.

## 1.0.0-beta.6 — S-6.01 create-adr skill + E-7 process codification (2026-04-26)

This release ships two CONVERGED feature deliveries (S-6.01 + E-7) plus
substantial spec backfill (10 ADRs, 27 BCs, 5 VPs, 2 FRs, 2 epics, 3 stories).
The standout meta-property is self-referential dogfooding: vsdd-factory used
its own VSDD process to find and codify gaps in vsdd-factory itself.

### Added

- **`/vsdd-factory:create-adr` skill (S-6.01).** Closes the per-artifact
  `create-*` skill family gap (alongside `create-prd`, `create-story`,
  `create-architecture`, `create-domain-spec`, `create-brief`). Scaffolds
  new ADR records with: collision-free ID allocation against `decisions/`
  filesystem AND ARCH-INDEX, frontmatter from `templates/adr-template.md`
  with `status=proposed` always at creation, optional bidirectional
  supersession patch (new ADR `supersedes:` ↔ old ADR `superseded_by:`),
  ARCH-INDEX row insertion in numeric order, optional `--brownfield`
  annotation, optional `--dry-run` flag, atomic-or-nothing rollback on
  any failure. Spec converged through 8 adversarial passes (trajectory
  19 → 4 → 2 → 1 → 1 → 0 → 0 → 0); 26 bats tests cover 8 ACs, 12 BCs
  (BC-6.20.001-012), 3 VPs (VP-058/059/060).
- **Process codification (E-7) — 8 lessons codified into plugin source:**
  - **Spec-First Gate** in `agents/story-writer.md`: blocks
    `status=ready` without canonical `BC-N.NN.NNN` pattern in
    `behavioral_contracts:` and AC↔BC bidirectional traces.
    (BC-5.36.001-002)
  - **Capability Anchor Justification** in `agents/product-owner.md`:
    every BC must verbatim-cite `capabilities.md` for its CAP.
    (BC-5.36.003-004)
  - **Partial-Fix-Regression discipline** in `agents/adversary.md`:
    every pass after pass-1 checks prior-pass fix propagation to
    bodies, sibling files, prose; flags `[process-gap]` for
    codification follow-up. (BC-5.36.005-006)
  - **Defensive Sweep discipline** in `agents/state-manager.md`:
    corpus-wide grep before declaring count-changing update complete.
    (BC-5.37.001-002)
  - **Cycle-Closing Checklist** in `agents/orchestrator/orchestrator.md`:
    references `rules/lessons-codification.md` before declaring
    sub-cycle CONVERGED. (BC-8.28.002)
  - **NEW hook `validate-count-propagation.sh`** (BC-7.05.001-002):
    PostToolUse drift detector across PRD / STATE.md / ARCH-INDEX /
    BC-INDEX / VP-INDEX. Exits 2 on drift, runs <500ms.
  - **NEW rule `rules/lessons-codification.md`** (BC-8.28.001):
    meta-discipline — every novel adversary process catch (not content
    defect) MUST trigger codification follow-up before sub-cycle closure.
  - **`validate-template-compliance.sh` extended** (BC-7.05.003) to
    enforce VP multi-BC `source_bc=primary, bcs[]=full list` convention.
  - **`hooks-registry.toml`** registers new hook (BC-7.05.004).

  Spec converged through 7 adversarial passes (trajectory
  12 → 5 → 1 → 2 → 2 → 0 → 0); 16 bats tests cover both stories.
- **Spec backfill — 10 ADRs (ADR-004..013):** TOML config; multi-sink
  observability natively in dispatcher; HOST_ABI_VERSION as separate
  semver constant; always-on dispatcher self-telemetry;
  parallel-within-tier sequential-between-tier execution;
  activation-skill-driven platform binary selection; StoreData-typed
  linker for host functions; dual hooks.json + hooks-registry.toml
  during migration; legacy-bash-adapter as universal current router;
  cycle-keyed adversarial review structure.
- **27 new behavioral contracts** across SS-05/06/07/08 (12 for
  create-adr, 15 for E-7 codification surfaces).
- **5 new verification properties** (VP-058..062 — atomicity, ID
  monotonicity proptest, bidirectional supersession, agent prompt
  static-check, multi-axis process-codification surface invariant).
- **2 new functional requirements** (FR-041, FR-042).
- **2 new epics** (E-6 VSDD Self-Improvement / Tooling Backlog;
  E-7 Process Codification — Self-Improvement).
- **L4-verification-property-template.md schema note** pinning
  `source_bc=primary, bcs[]=full list` convention for multi-BC VPs.

### Fixed

- **`validate-novelty-assessment.sh` false-positive on filename matchers.**
  Hook was matching `ADR-013-adversarial-review-structure.md` as a
  review file. Tightened the matcher to anchor on
  `.factory/cycles/<key>/adversarial-reviews/` directory paths; added
  explicit skip for `*/architecture/decisions/ADR-*.md`.

### Process Notes

The pass-4 reset on the e7-spec sub-cycle (F-020 SS-09 mis-citation
across two artifacts) was BC-5.36.005/006 partial-fix-regression
discipline working as designed: a fresh-perspective adversary caught
a 2-artifact mis-citation that 3 prior passes missed. The pass-1
review of E-7 specs caught a meta dogfood failure: PRD body still
cited "1,863-BC catalog" while the new BCs were being authored to
codify the very defensive-sweep tooling that detects this drift class.
Cumulative findings closed: 27 across 15 spec passes total.

### Identifier Counts (post-release)

| Type | Pre-beta.6 | Post-beta.6 |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| BCs (total) | 1,851 | 1,878 (+27) |
| VPs | 57 | 62 (+5) |
| FRs | 40 | 42 (+2) |
| Epics | 6 | 8 (+2) |
| Stories | 41 | 44 (+3) |
| ADRs | 3 | 13 (+10) |

### Migration

No breaking changes. Codified disciplines apply to NEW spec sub-cycles;
existing artifacts are not retroactively re-validated.

## 1.0.0-beta.5 — ADR template + identifier canonicalization (2026-04-25)

Same-day patch on top of beta.4. Two coupled improvements emerged from
the brownfield onboarding of vsdd-factory itself: a missing ADR
validation template and identifier-convention drift between the
plugin source and prism's working real-world usage.

### Added

- **`templates/adr-template.md`.** A canonical Architecture Decision
  Record template declaring `document_type: adr` plus the canonical H2
  sections (Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences with
  Positive/Negative/Status sub-headings, Alternatives Considered,
  Source / Origin). The `validate-template-compliance.sh` hook's
  primary lookup-by-document_type now matches ADR files against this
  template instead of falling through to `architecture-section-template`
  (which had been validating ADRs against the wrong schema and
  silently blocking ADR writes during plugin self-onboarding).

### Changed

- **Identifier conventions canonicalized to match prism's working
  pattern.** Three coupled changes across 26 plugin source files
  (templates + rules + 12 skills):
  - **BC shard layout:** flat `behavioral-contracts/BC-*.md` →
    sharded `behavioral-contracts/ss-NN/BC-*.md`. Required for any
    project with more than ~50 BCs.
  - **Story IDs:** `STORY-NNN` → `S-N.MM` (section.story zero-padded;
    e.g., `S-1.01`, `S-3.15`). Section grouping aligns with epics
    (`E-N`) and gives BC-anchoring traversal natural shape.
  - **Epic IDs:** `EPIC-NNN` → `E-N` (single-digit, matches story
    section number).

  Story `N` (section/epic) and BC `S` (subsystem number) are
  intentionally different hierarchies — a story can implement BCs
  from multiple subsystems via its `subsystems: [SS-NN, ...]`
  frontmatter array. This separation is now documented in
  `rules/spec-format.md`.

### Notes

- Pre-rc.1 projects using `STORY-NNN` continue to work — the
  validate-template-compliance hook keys on `document_type`, not ID
  format. New projects from beta.5 onward should use `S-N.MM` from
  the start.
- Phase 2 follow-up (test fixtures, workflows, agents) deferred to a
  future beta; not in this release.

### How discovered

vsdd-factory underwent its own brownfield onboarding cycle
(`v1.0-brownfield-backfill`) on 2026-04-25, producing 1,851 BCs
across 10 subsystems. The flat BC layout broke down at that scale,
exposing the plugin's stale assumption. Phase 1d adversarial review
converged in 6 passes (3 consecutive NITPICK), validating both the
new template and the canonicalized conventions.

## 1.0.0-beta.4 — cache fix + stderr capture + SHA-currency gate (2026-04-25)

Same-day patch on top of beta.3. Three follow-ups from the prior beta
loop, plus the new state-burst skill suite that codifies the wave-gate
bookkeeping defect class. None of these change the dispatcher's hot
path; they each close a paper-cut surface the prior iterations
exposed.

### Fixed

- **Plugin-cache staleness.** Claude Code's plugin-version cache keys
  on `plugin.json:version`. Until now, the operator's chore commit
  bumped that field but the matching binaries didn't exist yet — the
  bot's binary-bundle commit landed ~2 min later. Consumers fetching
  in that window cached "version X with X-1 binaries", and the cache
  never refreshed under that key. Fix: the chore commit no longer
  touches `plugin.json` or `marketplace.json`. The release workflow's
  bot commit reads the tag name and writes both JSON fields atomically
  with the binaries, so consumers never observe `version=X` without
  the matching binaries. **Operator workflow now commits only
  `CHANGELOG.md` for the release chore commit.**

### Added

- **Plugin stderr capture on lifecycle events.**
  `plugin.completed` / `plugin.crashed` / `plugin.timeout` events now
  carry the captured wasm plugin stderr (truncated to 4 KiB with an
  explicit `(stderr truncated)` marker). Empty stderr is omitted from
  the JSON to avoid noise on well-behaved plugins. Diagnoses plugin
  failures without requiring a manual re-run with stdout/stderr
  capture.
- **`vsdd-factory:state-burst` skill** + canonical
  `verify-sha-currency.sh` template + `state-manager-checklist-template.md`
  + agent-prompt updates + `docs/lessons-learned/wave-gate-bookkeeping.md`.
  Codifies the Single Canonical SHA + Two-Commit Protocol that breaks
  a recurring SHA-drift / narrative-staleness defect class observed
  across six consecutive remediation passes in real-world dogfood.
  Operators opt in by copying `templates/verify-sha-currency.sh` into
  their project's `.factory/hooks/` and instantiating
  `templates/state-manager-checklist-template.md` as their checklist.
- **Adversary SHA-currency gate.** The
  `validate-wave-gate-prerequisite.sh` Claude Code hook now branches
  on subagent type. Adversary dispatches additionally call
  `.factory/hooks/verify-sha-currency.sh` (when present) and block on
  FAIL. Without this, the adversary could dispatch against a dirty
  factory-artifacts state and report stale-cite drift as "false
  positive" findings. No-op if the project hasn't installed the
  verify-sha-currency hook.

### Migration

No breaking changes for plugin authors. **Maintainers cutting
releases**: `bump-version.sh` no longer modifies `plugin.json` or
`marketplace.json`. Stage only `CHANGELOG.md` for the chore commit.
The Release workflow's bot commit handles the JSON bumps.

## 1.0.0-beta.3 — hook tool_response shape fix (2026-04-25)

Same-day patch on top of beta.2. With the dispatcher's
`hook_event_name` alias in place, the harness was finally invoking
hooks — but three PostToolUse:Bash hooks were silently no-op'ing
because their guards expected an `exit_code` field that Claude Code
doesn't send.

### Fixed

- **`tool_response` shape mismatch in three bash hooks.** Claude Code's
  harness sends `tool_response` for Bash with `interrupted`, `stdout`,
  `stderr`, `isImage`, `noOutputExpected` — NOT the `exit_code` field
  the documented schema implied. The affected hooks bailed when
  `exit_code` defaulted to `-1`, so even after the dispatcher started
  parsing envelopes correctly (beta.2), the events never landed.
  - `capture-commit-activity`, `capture-pr-activity`: prefer
    `exit_code` when the host sends it (back-compat for any future
    schema change), fall back to `interrupted` for Claude Code's
    actual shape.
  - `regression-gate`: same fallback chain; `interrupted=true` →
    fail, `interrupted=false` → pass when `exit_code` is absent.
- **`capture-commit-activity` first-line-only stdout parser.**
  Compound bash commands (e.g. `echo BEFORE; git commit ...`) put
  earlier output before the git-commit preamble. The new parser
  scans every stdout line for the `[<branch> <sha>] <message>`
  pattern and validates the bracket's last token as a 7–40 char hex
  SHA before treating the line as a commit.

### Verified end-to-end

Real harness `git commit` invocations produce `commit.made` events
in `factory-events-*.jsonl`. Confirmed against four prism repo
commits (4fd662ab, 400fedb5, 7617214d, 3fe36e4b) — first time
`commit.made` has fired through the v1.0 pipeline against the real
Claude Code harness.

### Migration

No breaking changes from beta.2. Operators on beta.1 or beta.2
should `/plugin update vsdd-factory@vsdd-factory:1.0.0-beta.3` and
re-run `/vsdd-factory:activate`. If Claude Code's plugin cache
serves stale beta.2 binaries (a known limitation around the
"chore + bot retag" window), wipe
`~/.claude/plugins/cache/vsdd-factory/vsdd-factory/1.0.0-beta.2/`
manually and restart the session.

## 1.0.0-beta.2 — harness payload schema fix (2026-04-25)

Same-day patch to v1.0.0-beta.1 that closes the gate-4 dogfood
criterion. Beta.1 architecturally worked but couldn't talk to the
real Claude Code harness because of a field-name mismatch in the
input envelope schema.

### Fixed

- **Dispatcher rejected real Claude Code harness envelopes.** The
  dispatcher's `HookPayload` struct deserialized `event_name`, but
  Claude Code's documented hooks payload uses `hook_event_name`.
  Every real harness invocation failed at parse time with "missing
  field `event_name` at line 1 column 320" → zero plugins ran →
  zero events emitted. Synthetic tests passed because we authored
  them with `event_name` (the SDK's canonical name) — they didn't
  catch the harness/dispatcher schema mismatch. Fixed via
  `#[serde(alias = "hook_event_name")]`. Both spellings now parse;
  canonical name stays `event_name` so the SDK's payload shape is
  unchanged.

### Added

- Regression test
  `payload::tests::accepts_hook_event_name_alias_from_real_harness`
  pinning the alias against a real-shape envelope. Smoke verified
  end-to-end: feeding the harness-shape payload to the dispatcher
  binary produces a clean PostToolUse/Bash dispatch into 3 plugins
  with `exit_code:0`.

### Migration

No breaking changes from beta.1. Operators on beta.1 should
`/plugin update vsdd-factory@vsdd-factory:1.0.0-beta.2` and re-run
`/vsdd-factory:activate` if their `hooks.json` is platform-stale.

## 1.0.0-beta.1 — Factory Plugin Kit beta (2026-04-25)

First v1.0 pre-release. v0.79.x's bash-hook dispatch model ran into an
unfixable upstream bug: Claude Code's `PostToolUse Bash` matcher
silently de-duplicated identical hook entries across events, so
`commit.made` emissions stopped reaching the observability pipeline.
The fix path was a full rewrite of the hook layer.

This beta replaces the v0.79.x bash-dispatch shape with a Rust
dispatcher (`factory-dispatcher`) that loads WASM hook plugins and
routes Claude Code events through them, plus a `legacy-bash-adapter`
WASM plugin that runs unported v0.79.x bash hooks unchanged on
Linux/macOS so the full hook set keeps working through the migration.

### Architecture

- New Rust workspace (`Cargo.toml`) with 9 member crates:
  - `factory-dispatcher` — the binary Claude Code now invokes per
    hook event. Loads `hooks-registry.toml`, matches plugins by
    event/tool, runs them in priority tiers (parallel within a tier
    via tokio + spawn_blocking around wasmtime), enforces wasmtime
    epoch + fuel budgets per plugin.
  - `vsdd-hook-sdk` + `vsdd-hook-sdk-macros` — the `#[hook]` proc-
    macro and host-fn wrappers external authors use to write WASM
    hooks. Targets `wasm32-wasip1`. SDK is publish-ready at 0.1.0;
    real `cargo publish` to crates.io ships separately.
  - `legacy-bash-adapter` — WASM plugin that bridges to existing
    bash hooks via `exec_subprocess("bash", [<script_path>], ...)`
    with the Q4 safety envelope (`shell_bypass_acknowledged`).
  - `capture-commit-activity` — workspace member crate; native
    WASM port lands in S-3.1 (Tier E).
  - `sink-core` + `sink-file` + `sink-otel-grpc` — observability
    sinks. File sink mirrors v0.79.x JSONL behavior so existing
    Grafana dashboards keep rendering with no changes.
- 5-platform cross-build matrix: darwin-arm64, darwin-x64
  (macos-15-intel after macOS-13 retirement), linux-x64, linux-arm64
  (cross-rs/cross), windows-x64. Pinned in `ci/platforms.yaml` with a
  drift gate (`scripts/check-platforms-drift.py`).
- HOST_ABI v1 frozen — see `crates/hook-sdk/HOST_ABI.md`.

### Migration

The migration is opt-in: marketplace `/plugin install
vsdd-factory@vsdd-factory` continues to default to `0.79.4`.
Operators upgrading to `1.0.0-beta.1` follow
`docs/guide/migrating-from-0.79.md`.

After install, run the new `/vsdd-factory:activate` skill — it
detects platform, copies `hooks.json.<platform>` over `hooks.json`,
and verifies the dispatcher binary is present + executable.

### Fixed

- The `PostToolUse Bash` matcher de-dup bug in Claude Code that
  motivated the rewrite (v0.79.4 was a partial workaround; this beta
  is the real fix because dispatch happens out-of-process now).
- `factory-dispatcher`'s `exec_subprocess` host fn now writes the
  result envelope into a guest-pre-allocated buffer instead of wasm
  memory offset 0 (which the SDK previously short-circuited to an
  empty Vec, making the legacy adapter pipeline unusable). Caught
  during S-2.7 regression validation.
- Three latent wiring gaps: `HostContext.plugin_root` was never
  populated from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`; `HostContext.env_view` was
  empty so `env_allow` produced empty subprocess env; bash subprocess
  cwd defaulted to the dispatcher's cwd instead of
  `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}`. All three needed for round-trip parity
  with v0.79.x bash hook behavior.

### Added

- `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks-registry.toml` — auto-generated by
  `scripts/generate-registry-from-hooks-json.sh` from the historical
  v0.79.x hooks.json (45 entries, all routed through
  `legacy-bash-adapter.wasm`). Idempotent regeneration.
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/regression-v1.0.bats` — 11 regression
  guards for the dispatcher → adapter → bash pipeline. Pins the
  post-fix end-state so future refactors can't silently regress.
- `crates/factory-dispatcher/tests/loads_legacy_registry.rs` — Rust
  integration test that the generated registry parses through
  `Registry::load`.
- `benches/legacy-adapter-latency.sh` — direct-vs-adapter latency
  benchmark scaffolding (median of 10 per hook). Adapter overhead
  budget validation lands when we re-baseline post-beta.
- `docs/guide/migrating-from-0.79.md` — operator-facing migration
  guide (skeleton flushes out in S-5.5; v1.0-beta.1 ships the
  Resolved-during-S-2.7 history + platform validation table).
- Platform-specific `hooks.json.{darwin-arm64,darwin-x64,linux-x64,
  linux-arm64,windows-x64}` variants (CI-generated from
  `hooks.json.template`); the activate skill picks the right one per
  install.

### Tests

87 dispatcher lib + 14 adapter + 18 host integration + 20 sdk + 17
sink + 13 macros + 11 regression-v1.0 bats + 6 generate-registry bats
+ 1245 baseline bats — all green at this tag. Adapter wasm builds
cleanly on every CI platform. SDK publish dry-run clean.

### Known limitations (non-blocking for beta)

- Plugin stderr is allocated as a `MemoryOutputPipe` but not
  forwarded to the dispatcher-internal log. Plugin failures show up
  as `exit_code:1` on `plugin.completed` without the stderr text.
  Diagnostic-only; tracked for post-beta.
- Windows: `legacy-bash-adapter` requires git-bash. Native WASM hooks
  (capture-commit-activity, capture-pr-activity, block-ai-attribution
  in Phase 3) will work without it.
- Real `cargo publish` of `vsdd-hook-sdk` to crates.io happens at the
  release workflow's discretion; the workspace dry-run gate in CI is
  the standing guard.

## 0.79.4 — drop matcher field entirely on PostToolUse Bash hooks (Claude Code harness workaround)

v0.79.3 replaced `"matcher": "Bash"` with `"matcher": "*"` and still
saw zero `commit.made` emissions in prism post-restart. The `"*"`
literal apparently isn't treated as match-any by Claude Code's
resolver — it's either rejected silently or hits the same dedup bug.

Reference repo [shanraisshan/claude-code-hooks](https://github.com/shanraisshan/claude-code-hooks)
uses **no `matcher` field at all** on any of its 27 hook event
entries (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `SubagentStop`, etc.). Their
dispatcher self-dispatches based on `hook_event_name` and `tool_name`
from the stdin JSON payload. Verified in production.

### Changed

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/hooks.json`** — remove the `matcher`
  field from the `PostToolUse` Bash-intent entry. The three hooks
  (`regression-gate`, `capture-pr-activity`, `capture-commit-activity`)
  already self-filter on `tool_name` internally, so matching every
  tool invocation (which is what absent-matcher means per the
  reference implementation) and early-exiting for non-Bash is a
  no-op for behavior.
- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/capture-commit-activity.bats`**,
  **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/factory-obs.bats`** — assertions
  relaxed to "hook is registered under PostToolUse," agnostic to
  the matcher field (already made this change in v0.79.3 for
  `select(.matcher == "Bash")`; this confirms they remain correct
  when the field is absent entirely).

### Rationale

This is the last configuration-only workaround we can try. If this
doesn't restore dispatch, the bug is upstream harness state that no
plugin-side change can fix. Any further attempts would require
rearchitecting the hook system — which is scoped for **v1.0.0**
(Rust dispatcher, cross-platform support, per-hook toggles, full
Claude Code event coverage). Design doc to follow.

### Migration

No migration needed. Install and **fully restart the Claude Code
session** (hot-upgrades don't reliably rewire hooks).

## 0.79.3 — replace PostToolUse "Bash" matcher with "*" (Claude Code harness workaround)

v0.79.2 reordered the `PostToolUse` array to test whether the bug was
positional — it wasn't. With `Bash` as the *first* entry and
`Edit|Write` as the second, `PostToolUse:Bash` was still silent while
`PostToolUse:Edit|Write` fired normally. Post-restart test in prism
produced zero `commit.made` events despite the reorder.

Refined bug theory: the Claude Code harness can't wire both
`(PreToolUse, "Bash")` AND `(PostToolUse, "Bash")` in the same plugin
— one of them is always dropped. Matches upstream
[claude-code #52715](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/52715)
where the opposite direction is silent
(`PreToolUse:Bash` silent, `PostToolUse:Bash` fires). Looks like
`matcher: "Bash"` gets deduplicated across event types.

### Changed

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/hooks.json`** — change the
  `PostToolUse` Bash-intent matcher from `"Bash"` to `"*"`. The
  three hooks under that entry (`regression-gate`,
  `capture-pr-activity`, `capture-commit-activity`) already
  self-filter on `tool_name` (see `capture-commit-activity.sh:40-43`,
  `capture-pr-activity.sh:33-35`, `regression-gate.sh:21-22`), so
  matching every tool and early-exiting for non-Bash is a behavioral
  no-op — just trades ~6ms per non-Bash tool call for the chance to
  escape the harness dedup bug. `PreToolUse:Bash` (block-ai-attribution,
  destructive-command-guard, protect-secrets, verify-git-push,
  check-factory-commit) stays as-is since it fires fine.

### Migration

No migration needed. Install and **fully restart the Claude Code
session** (hot-upgrades don't reliably rewire hooks). If `commit.made`
events appear in `.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` after the restart,
the dedup theory is confirmed and the Factory ROI dashboard becomes
honest.

## 0.79.2 — reorder PostToolUse matchers (Claude Code harness workaround)

Speculative fix for an observed Claude Code harness bug where the
`PostToolUse` hooks registered under `matcher: "Bash"` were silently
never dispatched in live sessions — zero emissions across two full
days despite dozens of real `git commit` and `gh pr` invocations.
Manual invocation of the hook scripts (piping synthetic payloads into
them) produced correct output, and `emit-event` wrote events
correctly. The silence was specific to the `(PostToolUse, Bash)` pair
while `(PreToolUse, Bash)` and `(PostToolUse, Edit|Write)` both fired
normally from the same `hooks.json`.

The only meaningful structural difference was position in the
`PostToolUse` array — `Edit|Write` was the first entry, `Bash` the
second. Upstream issue
[claude-code #52715](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/52715)
reports the mirror-image symptom (`PreToolUse` + `Bash` silent while
`PostToolUse` + `Bash` fires), suggesting a harness-level registration
bug that drops one `(EventType, "Bash")` pair when multiple matcher
entries coexist.

### Changed

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/hooks.json`** — reordered
  `PostToolUse` matcher entries so `Bash` is first and `Edit|Write`
  second. Hook behavior is unchanged; only the array order differs.
  If this does not restore `capture-commit-activity` /
  `capture-pr-activity` / `regression-gate` emissions, the fallback
  plan is to collapse to a single `"*"` matcher entry with internal
  per-script tool filtering (all three Bash hooks already filter on
  `tool_name`, so this is a no-op for them).

### Fixed

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/input-hash.bats`**,
  **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tests/template-compliance.bats`** —
  replaced `.hooks.PostToolUse[0]` index lookups with
  `.hooks.PostToolUse[]` (iterate all entries) so assertions survive
  future matcher-array ordering changes.

### Migration

No migration needed. Install the new version and **restart the
Claude Code session** — plugin hot-upgrades mid-session do not
reliably rewire hooks (that's how we got here).

## 0.79.1 — bump-version.sh idempotent CHANGELOG guard

Tiny tooling fix. Three releases in a row (v0.76.1 / v0.78.1 /
v0.79.0) shipped with a stub "TODO: fill in release title" heading
in their GitHub release notes. Root cause: `scripts/bump-version.sh`
unconditionally prepended a stub heading to `CHANGELOG.md`, which
raced with my workflow of writing the real entry beforehand (the
stub edit collided with my in-progress Edit of the pre-written
entry, and the stub won).

### Fixed

- **`scripts/bump-version.sh`** — added a guard that checks for an
  existing `## <new-version>` heading before prepending. If the
  user (or tooling) already wrote the entry, the script skips the
  stub injection, preserves the real content, and prints a status
  line saying the entry was already present. No more racy stub
  overwrites.

- Also fixed a pre-existing shellcheck SC2059 in the `printf`
  format-string usage so the script is clean under `shellcheck`
  (no behavior change, just hygiene).

### Migration

No behavior change for the preferred flow (write CHANGELOG first,
then run bump-version.sh). The legacy "bump first, edit after" flow
still works but prints a TODO stub as before — users just need to
remember to fill it in before committing.

## 0.79.0 — Observability onboarding: model-invocable skills + one-step setup

Before this release, "register this project with the observability
stack" was not discoverable to an orchestrator agent — both
`factory-obs` and `claude-telemetry` skills had
`disable-model-invocation: true` in their frontmatter, so the model
couldn't auto-match the user's request to the skill, and a user had
to explicitly type `/vsdd-factory:factory-obs register` and
`/vsdd-factory:claude-telemetry on`. This release makes the
onboarding flow discoverable and automatable.

### Added

- **New `/vsdd-factory:onboard-observability` skill + command alias**
  (`plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/onboard-observability/SKILL.md`,
  `plugins/vsdd-factory/commands/onboard-observability.md`).
  One-command first-time setup that:
  1. Runs `factory-obs register` on the current project (adds its
     `.factory/logs/` to the collector's watch list).
  2. Writes the 5 `OTEL_*` env vars to `.claude/settings.local.json`
     (same operation as `claude-telemetry on`, inlined so the skill
     is self-contained).
  3. Prints a concise summary + next-step reminder (restart Claude
     to pick up OTel env vars; run `factory-obs up` if the stack
     isn't already running).

  Idempotent — safe to re-run. Model-invocable — the skill's
  description matches phrases like "register this project with
  observability", "set up observability here", "onboard the
  observability stack".

- **Getting-started guide** (`docs/guide/getting-started.md`) gained
  a "5. (Optional) Wire the project into the observability stack"
  step in the first-time setup section, documenting the new skill
  and the underlying two-step workflow.

- **Commands reference** (`docs/guide/commands-reference.md`) gained
  an "Infrastructure" row for each of the three observability
  commands (`factory-obs`, `claude-telemetry`,
  `onboard-observability`) so they're discoverable in the
  documented command catalog.

### Changed

- **`factory-obs` skill frontmatter** — removed
  `disable-model-invocation: true`. The model can now auto-invoke
  `factory-obs` when the user says things like "start the
  observability stack", "open the Grafana dashboards", "register
  this factory", etc. Description copy tightened to cover the new
  invocation cases.

- **`claude-telemetry` skill frontmatter** — removed
  `disable-model-invocation: true`. Auto-invocation matches on
  phrases like "enable Claude telemetry", "turn on Claude OTel
  export", "why aren't Claude's metrics showing up". Description
  copy tightened.

### Why this matters for orchestration

An orchestrator agent spun up in a fresh project can now handle the
observability onboarding request end-to-end with a single user
phrase. Before: the user had to know the exact slash-command syntax
and run two separate commands. After: "register this project with
the observability stack" or "set up observability here" both match
`onboard-observability` directly, and the agent executes both steps.

### Safety

Flipping `disable-model-invocation` slightly increases noise —
mentions of "observability" or "telemetry" in an unrelated context
could now match these skills. Mitigated by the descriptions being
specific about the use cases ("Use when the user asks to …"). None
of these skills take destructive actions without explicit user
intent, and both existing sub-skills already ran without invocation
gating before — flipping the frontmatter only changes *discovery*.

### Tests

- New `skills.bats` assertions: `factory-obs`, `claude-telemetry`,
  and `onboard-observability` must NOT have
  `disable-model-invocation: true` (regression guard). The
  `onboard-observability` skill must describe both halves of the
  workflow and state idempotency.
- Full suite: 1177 tests, all passing.

## 0.78.2 — Docs refresh for the observability stack (v0.66 → v0.78)

Documentation-only release. No runtime code or config changes — safe
to skip from a deployment standpoint. Every piece of observability
documentation was stale by 10+ releases:

- The top-level `README.md` and `docs/guide/observability.md`
  described the original "3-container" stack from v0.66.0 (OTel +
  Loki + Grafana) even though v0.78.1 ships 5 services + an init
  container.
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/factory-obs/SKILL.md` listed only
  the original 6 subcommands; missed the 4 new ones from v0.78.0
  (`register`, `unregister`, `list`, `regenerate`).
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/README.md`'s
  architecture diagram still showed the v0.66 topology without
  Prometheus, the renderer sidecar, or the OTLP metrics path.
- `docs/guide/hooks-reference.md` was missing `capture-pr-activity.sh`
  (v0.73.1) and `capture-commit-activity.sh` (v0.77.0) entirely.
- The observability Roadmap table stopped at v0.68.0.

### Changed

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — opening paragraph now reflects
  v0.78.1 state (5-service stack, 7 dashboards, multi-factory,
  Prometheus). The "factory-obs + Docker stack" section expanded
  with the full service list, lifecycle, multi-factory workflow,
  dashboard catalog, and the `capture-pr-activity` / 
  `capture-commit-activity` companion-signal hooks. Roadmap table
  updated with phases 7–13 through v0.78.0 + planned items.

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/README.md`** —
  architecture ASCII diagram redrawn to show OTel collector →
  Loki + Prometheus split and the Grafana + renderer sidecar
  topology. "What ships" list now covers all 5 services, 7
  dashboards, and the companion `loki-config.yaml` +
  `prometheus-config.yaml` artifacts.

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/skills/factory-obs/SKILL.md`** —
  description frontmatter updated to name all 5 services and
  mention multi-factory. Subcommand table now includes `register`,
  `unregister`, `list`, and `regenerate`. Env-var list expanded
  with `VSDD_OBS_PROMETHEUS_PORT`, `VSDD_OBS_RENDERER_PORT`, and
  `VSDD_OBS_REGISTRY`. New "When to use" entries for the registry
  commands. Non-goals clarified to explain that registration is
  explicit by design.

- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — added rows to the Hook
  Summary table and new Hook Details sections for
  `capture-pr-activity.sh` (PR event capture with open→merge
  duration pairing) and `capture-commit-activity.sh` (commit
  event capture backing the rebuilt Cost per commit panel).

- **`README.md`** — Observability row in the docs index now
  mentions the local stack and multi-factory registry, not just
  the event-log schema.

### Migration

No breaking changes. No runtime behavior change.

## 0.78.1 — Shellcheck hint fix on v0.78.0 factory-obs

Tiny fix release — v0.78.0's Release workflow failed its shellcheck
contract test because the `_find_factory_root` helper takes an
optional `$1` that's never passed explicitly (all call sites rely on
the `$PWD` default). Shellcheck's SC2120/SC2119 info-level checks
flagged it.

### Fixed

- `bin/factory-obs` — added `# shellcheck disable=SC2120` on
  `_find_factory_root` with an inline note explaining why the
  optional-arg pattern is intentional. No behavior change.

### Migration

No breaking changes. Identical runtime behavior to v0.78.0.

## 0.78.0 — Multi-factory watch: register/list/unregister + dynamic compose override

The observability stack can now aggregate events from any number of
factory projects, wherever they live on the filesystem. This fixes a
blind spot surfaced during the 2026-04-23 live-stack audit: the stack
was only watching its own `.factory/logs/` because the bind mount was
hard-coded relative to the plugin's install location. Projects
installed anywhere else (e.g., `~/Dev/prism`, `~/work/api`, `/opt/team/…`)
had their hook events silently dropped even while their Claude OTel
telemetry flowed normally.

### Fixed

- **Silent data loss on additional factories**: any factory project
  outside the plugin install tree was previously invisible to Loki
  because the otel-collector's bind mount was anchored to the plugin's
  own `.factory/logs/`. Now every registered factory is mounted
  explicitly at `/var/log/factory/<safe-name>/`, and the collector's
  filelog receiver globs `/var/log/factory/*/events-*.jsonl` to pick
  them all up.

### Added

- **`bin/factory-obs register [PATH]`** — add a factory to the watched
  list. With no argument, autoresolves the nearest ancestor directory
  containing `.factory/` from `cwd`. Refuses relative paths and
  non-factory directories. Dedups if the absolute path is already
  registered.

- **`bin/factory-obs unregister [PATH]`** — remove a factory from the
  watched list. Same `cwd` autoresolution as register. No-op (not an
  error) when the path isn't registered.

- **`bin/factory-obs list`** — print all registered factories with
  their safe-names and filesystem status. Flags paths whose
  `.factory/` subdirectory has gone missing so users can clean up
  stale entries.

- **`bin/factory-obs regenerate`** — rewrite
  `tools/observability/docker-compose.override.yml` from the current
  registry without starting or restarting the stack. Primarily for
  tests and scripting; `up` always calls it implicitly.

- **Registry file** at `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/vsdd-factory/watched-factories`.
  One absolute path per line, `#` comments allowed. Managed via the
  CLI; users generally shouldn't edit by hand.
  Override via `VSDD_OBS_REGISTRY=<path>` (primarily for tests).

### Changed

- **`tools/observability/docker-compose.yml`** — the hard-coded
  `${VSDD_FACTORY_LOGS:-…}:/var/log/factory:ro` bind mount is removed
  from the base compose. Per-factory mounts are now injected by the
  generated override file. The base compose is no longer usable on
  its own — always use `factory-obs up` (or
  `docker compose -f base.yml -f override.yml …` with the override
  already generated).

- **`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`** — filelog
  `include` glob changed from `/var/log/factory/events-*.jsonl` to
  `/var/log/factory/*/events-*.jsonl` to match the per-factory
  subdirectory layout.

- **`tools/observability/README.md`** — new "Watching multiple
  factories" section documenting the registry workflow.

### Migration

No action required for single-factory users: running `factory-obs up`
from inside a factory project still works exactly as before (empty
registry → autoresolve `cwd`). The `VSDD_FACTORY_LOGS` single-path
fallback is preserved.

For multi-factory users, the recommended setup is:

```bash
cd ~/Dev/project-a && factory-obs register
cd ~/Dev/project-b && factory-obs register
factory-obs list         # verify
factory-obs up           # apply
```

### Notes

- The generated `docker-compose.override.yml` is `.gitignore`-d so
  each dev machine maintains its own multi-factory layout without
  leaking into commits.
- Safe-name format is `<basename>-<8-char-sha>`. Two projects sharing
  a basename (e.g., `api`) get distinct mounts because the sha
  derives from the full absolute path.

### Tests

- New `tests/factory-obs-registry.bats` — 19 tests covering register
  (success, cwd autoresolve, dedup, invalid inputs), unregister,
  list, regenerate (mount shapes, fallbacks, safe-name disambiguation).
- Updated `tests/factory-obs.bats` — asserts base compose no longer
  hard-codes a `.factory/logs` volume, and that the collector's
  filelog glob uses the multi-factory subdirectory pattern.
- Full suite: **1193 tests**, all passing.

## 0.77.1 — Factory ROI: Cost per active minute + Cost per active second

Additive re-units for the Cost per active hour panel shipped in v0.77.0.
Same underlying Claude SDK signal (`claude_code_active_time_seconds_total`),
different time scales so the displayed value reads naturally for typical
Claude Code usage patterns.

### Added

- **`grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json` — Cost per active minute panel
  (id=13)** — `cost / (active_time / 60)`. Sits alongside Cost per active
  hour at y=8. Typical reading: tens of dollars per sustained-compute
  minute with Opus 4.7.

- **`grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json` — Cost per active second panel
  (id=14)** — `cost / active_time`. The rawest reading of the same
  signal. Typical: ~$0.50–$2.00 per second of sustained compute. Useful
  as a sanity-check — this is roughly what the LLM is charging you in
  the moment.

All three panels (hour, minute, second) render identical underlying
math; only the display unit differs. Descriptions on each clarify that
Claude's `active_time` measures **sustained compute windows**, not
wall-clock engagement, so these are burst-rate signals rather than
actual per-hour / per-minute / per-second spend.

### Migration

No breaking changes. Layout unchanged — the two new panels fill empty
grid slots at x=8, y=8 and x=16, y=8 on the existing row.

Total bats tests: 1154 (up from 1153 at v0.77.0 — one new test covers
both re-unit panels).

## 0.77.0 — Fix Cost per commit (real signal) + add Cost per active hour

Replaces a ghost panel that had been showing N/A since v0.74.0, and adds
one complementary Prom-native ROI panel.

### The bug we uncovered

The Factory ROI dashboard's "Cost per commit" and "Commits" stat panels
both depended on `claude_code_commit_count_total` — a Prometheus counter
that's listed in Claude Code's OTel metric reference but **never
actually emitted by the SDK in our sessions**. Across the full 30-day
Prometheus retention, the series was empty. The panels silently read
"N/A" and "0" from v0.74.0 through v0.76.1 even while sessions were
actively committing. Our test only verified the panels *existed*, not
that their metrics resolved.

### Fixed

- **`hooks/capture-commit-activity.sh`** — new `PostToolUse` Bash hook,
  modeled on `capture-pr-activity.sh`. Matches `git commit` invocations
  (with word-boundary anchoring so `git commit-tree`, echoed text, and
  aliases don't spuriously trigger) and emits a structured
  `commit.made` event on success:
  - `commit_sha` — parsed from the `[<branch> <sha>]` preamble git
    prints on successful commits.
  - `branch` — first token of the same preamble; supports `feature/x`,
    `HEAD detached at <prev> <new>`, and `(root-commit)` shapes.
  - `message_subject` — first-line text after the preamble.
  - `amended="true"` — flagged when `--amend` was in the command, so
    downstream panels can exclude amends if desired.

  Failed commits are no-ops (pre-commit hook rejections shouldn't
  count against cost-per-commit). `git commit --dry-run` is a no-op.
  Absent/malformed `[<branch> <sha>]` preambles are no-ops. 21 bats
  tests cover structural, positive, filter-tightness, malformed-stdout,
  and graceful-degradation paths.

- **`grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json` — Commits panel (id=3)** —
  datasource switched from Prometheus to Loki, query switched to
  `sum(count_over_time({service_name="vsdd-factory",event_type="commit.made"}[$__range]))`.
  Now reports the count that actually happened in the range.

- **`grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json` — Cost per commit panel
  (id=6)** — rebuilt using the same cross-datasource pattern we
  proved out in v0.76.0:
  - refA = `sum(increase(claude_code_cost_usage_USD_total[$__range]))`
    (Prometheus instant).
  - refB = `sum(count_over_time({service_name="vsdd-factory",event_type="commit.made"}[$__range]))`
    (Loki instant).
  - refC = `__expr__` math with `expression: "$A / $B"`.
  - `filterByRefId` transform keeps only C for display.

  Verified end-to-end via the renderer sidecar: rendered **$0.3263**
  over a 24h window against live data. First time this panel has
  computed a real number since v0.74.0 shipped.

### Added

- **`grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json` — Cost per active hour
  panel (id=12)** — new Prom-native stat, independent of git
  workflow:
  `cost / (active_time / 3600)`. Uses
  `claude_code_active_time_seconds_total`, which Claude's SDK DOES
  emit reliably. The panel description flags an important subtlety:
  `active_time` measures **sustained compute time** (streaming-response
  and tool-execution windows), not wall-clock session engagement. A
  typical session accumulates seconds-to-minutes of "active time", so
  the headline number represents the **sustained-compute hourly rate**,
  not an actual hourly spend. Useful as a stable rate signal,
  complementing cost-per-output-unit (PR / commit / story) panels.

### Notes

- Layout shift on Factory ROI: the new Cost-per-active-hour row pushes
  the `Cost over time` / `Output over time` timeseries from y=8 to
  y=12, and the `Cost by query source` / `Subagent dispatch efficiency`
  row from y=16 to y=20. No panels deleted.

- Total bats tests: **1153** (up from 1129 at v0.76.1 — 21 new for
  the commit hook, 3 new for the ROI panel shapes, 1 adjusted for the
  rebuilt Cost per commit).

## 0.76.1 — CI test-infra fix for Release workflow

Tiny release that unblocks the `Release` GitHub Actions workflow. No
runtime code changes; safe to consume alongside v0.76.0.

### Fixed

- `tests/emit-event.bats` — the worktree-resolution test at
  `@test "emit-event: resolves to main worktree's .factory/logs…"`
  was making a `git commit --allow-empty` inside a fresh `mktemp -d`
  repo, which fails on GitHub Actions runners because they don't
  have a global git identity. Set `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*`
  env vars at test scope so the commit succeeds without touching
  the runner's git config. This had been silently failing the
  `Release` workflow since v0.75.0 — both v0.75.0 and v0.76.0 have
  valid tags but no GitHub Release artifact as a result. v0.76.1
  is the first release that should produce a GitHub Release
  automatically again.

### Migration

No breaking changes. If you're on v0.76.0, the only difference at
v0.76.1 is the test file. No dashboard, skill, hook, or collector
config changes.

## 0.76.0 — Observability stack upgrade: Grafana v13 + OTel 0.149 + Loki 3.6 + Prom v3

Coordinated major-version bump of the entire local observability stack.
The headline outcome: **Factory ROI's `Cost per PR merged` and `Cost per
story touched` panels now compute real values end-to-end** — the first
time cross-datasource Prometheus ÷ Loki math has worked since we tried
it in v0.74.0. Along the way: simplified Claude telemetry UX, closed
two backlog items, and fixed several breaking changes that the stack
upgrade surfaced.

### Version pins (docker-compose.yml)

- **Grafana** `10.4.2` → `13.0.1` — unlocks server-side expression
  queries (`datasource: { type: "__expr__" }`), which is the canonical
  v11+ pattern for cross-datasource math. This is what finally makes
  cost-per-X panels computable.
- **OTel Collector Contrib** `0.94.0` → `0.149.0` — unlocks the
  `deltatocumulative` processor (added in 0.115). With it wired into
  the metrics pipeline, Claude's DELTA-temporality counters are
  converted in-flight before Prometheus's `remote_write` receiver
  sees them, so `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE`
  is no longer required at the Claude side.
- **Loki** `3.0.0` → `3.6.10` — the image is now full distroless (no
  shell, no `wget`, no probes). We replaced the Docker `HEALTHCHECK`
  with a one-shot `loki-ready` init container that polls `/ready`
  from a busybox image on the shared network; downstream services
  (otel-collector, grafana) wait on `loki-ready` via
  `condition: service_completed_successfully`.
- **Prometheus** `v2.54.0` → `v3.5.2` — `remote_write` receive +
  PromQL query APIs we use are stable across v2→v3.

### Added

- **`tools/observability/loki-config.yaml`** — previously used Loki's
  built-in defaults. Now we ship an explicit config that:
  - Raises `reject_old_samples_max_age` to 30 days so the collector
    can backfill historical `.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` entries
    across a stack restart without Loki 400-ing whole batches. This
    was a hidden data-loss path under the old default (~2h window).
  - Declares the Loki-side `otlp_config.resource_attributes`
    promotion list (`service.name`, `event_type`, `hook`, `reason`,
    `severity`). Previously we relied on the collector's standalone
    `loki` exporter honoring a `loki.resource.labels` hint attribute.
    That exporter was removed in collector-contrib ~0.112, so we
    ship the labels via Loki's native OTLP ingester and let Loki
    own the label decision.

- **`tools/observability/docker-compose.yml` `renderer` service** —
  Grafana Image Renderer 3.11.0 sidecar is now part of the default
  stack. Enables `/render/d-solo/...` for programmatic PNG/PDF export
  of any panel. Shared auth token with Grafana
  (`GF_RENDERING_RENDERER_TOKEN` ↔ `AUTH_TOKEN`) since Grafana v11+
  refuses the library default. Closes backlog task #104.

- **`tools/observability/docker-compose.yml` `loki-ready` service** —
  tiny busybox init container that polls Loki's HTTP `/ready`
  endpoint and exits 0. Downstream services gate on it via
  `service_completed_successfully`. Replaces the broken
  `wget`-based `HEALTHCHECK` that Loki 3.6's distroless image can
  no longer run.

### Fixed

- **`otel-collector-config.yaml` metrics pipeline** — wired the
  `deltatocumulative` processor (ordered before
  `prometheusremotewrite`). Claude's metrics (cost, token counts,
  session durations) now land in Prometheus without the temporality
  env-var workaround.

- **`otel-collector-config.yaml` logs exporter** — switched from the
  removed `loki:` exporter to `otlphttp/loki:` targeting
  `http://loki:3100/otlp`. Loki 3.x's native OTLP ingester appends
  `/v1/logs` automatically.

- **`otel-collector-config.yaml` move operators** — added
  `if: 'attributes.type != nil'` guard on the `move` that promotes
  the event `type` to `resource.event_type`. collector-contrib 0.149
  is strictly-failing where 0.94 was lenient: a single malformed
  event with no `type` field (e.g. one written by an
  incorrectly-invoked emit-event) would otherwise halt the entire
  filelog tailer for that cycle. Matches the existing guards on
  `hook`, `reason`, `severity`.

- **`grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json`** — the two markdown
  fallback panels are **back to real stat panels**, each doing a
  live Prometheus-cost / Loki-count division via a server-side
  expression query. Structure:
  - refA: Prometheus instant query (`sum(increase(...[$__range]))`)
  - refB: Loki instant query (`sum(count_over_time(...[$__range]))`)
  - refC: `__expr__` math query with `expression: "$A / $B"`
  - `filterByRefId` transform keeps only C for display

  This pattern works on every Grafana version from 9.x forward —
  the reason we weren't using it earlier is that nobody had reached
  for server-side expressions. Unblocks real cost-per-X visibility
  in the ROI dashboard without requiring task #105 (Prom-native
  counters) to land.

### Removed

- **`otel-collector-config.yaml` `attributes/loki-label-hint`
  processor** — dead code after the `loki` exporter's removal. Loki
  now owns label promotion via its own `otlp_config`. Pipeline is
  simpler: `[batch, resource]` instead of
  `[batch, resource, attributes/loki-label-hint]`.

### Changed

- **`skills/claude-telemetry/SKILL.md`** — the env var list is back
  down to 5 (from 6). `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE`
  is obsolete now that `deltatocumulative` runs in the collector.
  The `on` path prunes the legacy key on re-run for users who
  configured it via an earlier release; `off` also cleans it up.
  `status` flags the legacy key as stale if present.

### Notes

- Historical events in `.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` older than
  about 6 hours at the time of stack restart may not be re-indexed
  into Loki. The collector's file_storage remembers the last offset,
  and Loki's 30d acceptance window doesn't apply retroactively to
  events that were briefly rejected on a prior run. Fresh events
  flow normally.

- Total bats tests: **1129** (up from 1117 at v0.75.0 — 12 new
  tests cover the upgrade surface).

## 0.75.0 — Subagent dashboard + PR duration pairing + honest ROI fallback

Three backlog items closed in one release, plus a honest admission on a
known limitation.

### Added

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-subagents.json`** —
  new "Factory Subagents — Usage & Exit Classes" dashboard. 8 panels:
  total dispatches, unique subagent types, ok/non-ok stop counts,
  top-15 invocation bargauge, exit-class distribution stacked bars,
  per-subagent activity timeline, and a recent-events log feed.
  Closes backlog task #91.

- **`hooks/capture-pr-activity.sh`** — PR duration pairing. On
  `gh pr merge` success, the hook now scans recent
  `.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` files for a matching `pr.opened`
  event with the same `pr_number`, computes the elapsed time, and
  attaches `open_to_merge_seconds` to the emitted `pr.merged` event.
  Bounded to last 7 days of log files for runtime. Absurd durations
  (>30 days, negative) are rejected to protect against PR-number
  collisions across weeks. 3 new bats tests (18 total for this hook).

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-prs.json`** —
  two new panels using the new duration data:
  - "Avg open→merge duration" (stat, seconds) — uses LogQL `unwrap
    attributes_open_to_merge_seconds` + sum/count division to compute
    mean.
  - "PRs with duration recorded" (stat) — how many `pr.merged`
    events actually carried a duration, so users can see data
    coverage without being misled by a tiny sample.

### Fixed / Changed

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json`** —
  replaced the two broken cross-datasource derived panels
  ("Cost per PR merged" and "Cost per story touched") with
  markdown text panels that explain how to compute the ratio from
  the raw stats above. The underlying problem: Grafana v10.4.2's
  `calculateField` binary transform doesn't reliably resolve field
  references across mixed Prometheus+Loki frames. Multiple patterns
  were tried (joinByField, merge, seriesToColumns, legendFormat
  rename, Value #A naming) — none produced a reliable divide.
  "Cost per commit" (Prom-native, real division) is unchanged and
  remains the one working derived ratio.

### Known limitation & follow-up

- Cross-datasource cost-per-X panels deferred to task #105: emit
  Prometheus-native counters for factory events (PRs merged,
  stories touched). Once those metrics exist, divisions become
  Prom-native and the text panels can become real stat panels.

- Task #104: adding `grafana/grafana-image-renderer` to the
  observability stack. Makes panel verification programmatic for
  future debugging (this release's ROI-transform debugging would
  have been ~5× faster with it).

### Verified live

All 7 dashboards load in Grafana's "VSDD Factory" folder. The new
duration panel renders "N/A" until a PR open→merge cycle completes
with both events captured. All 82 bats tests pass (suite grew with
3 new PR-duration cases + 2 updated ROI-dashboard cases).

### Migration

`factory-obs down && factory-obs up` (or `docker restart
vsdd-obs-grafana`) to reload the new dashboards. Existing hook events
are untouched — the duration pairing only affects future `pr.merged`
emissions.

## 0.74.0 — Factory ROI dashboard (Phase C — cost/ROI series complete)

Completes the three-phase cost-and-ROI build-out. Phase A (v0.72.0)
laid the Prometheus foundation and Factory Today. Phase B (v0.73.0)
shipped the Claude Cost dashboard. Phase C (this release) answers the
third question in the original trio: **"what was our ROI?"**

### Added

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-roi.json`** —
  new "Factory ROI — Cost vs Output" dashboard. 11 panels combining
  Prometheus (cost) with Loki (output event counts) via Grafana
  mixed-datasource transformations:

  Top row — raw totals (4 stats):
  - Total cost (USD, Prometheus)
  - PRs merged (Loki pr.merged count)
  - Commits (Prometheus claude_code_commit_count_total)
  - Stories touched (distinct attributes_story_id on agent.start)

  Derived ratios (3 stats, noValue=N/A):
  - **Cost per PR merged** — cross-datasource; `joinByField` +
    `calculateField` Grafana transforms divide Prom cost by Loki count.
  - **Cost per commit** — Prom-native division
    (claude_code_cost_usage_USD_total / claude_code_commit_count_total).
  - **Cost per story touched** — cross-datasource, Prom cost / Loki
    distinct-story count.

  Trends (2 timeseries):
  - Cost over time
  - Output over time (agent.start + pr.opened + pr.merged bars)
    — designed to read side-by-side with "Cost over time" so
    expensive-but-unproductive windows stand out visually.

  Breakdown (2):
  - Cost by query_source (pie: main / subagent / auxiliary) —
    where the spend actually goes.
  - Subagent dispatch efficiency (bargauge: top 10 subagents by
    invocation count).

### Cross-datasource mechanic

Grafana "Mixed" datasource with two targets:
- `refId: COST` (Prometheus)
- `refId: PRS` (Loki)

Transformations chain:
1. `joinByField { byField: "Time", mode: "outer" }` — aligns the
   two series on the time axis.
2. `calculateField { binary: { left: COST, operator: "/", right: PRS },
   replaceFields: true }` — divides and emits a single value field.

Result renders as a stat panel showing a dollar amount. `noValue: "N/A"`
covers the division-by-zero case for quiet periods.

### ROI story complete

Three dashboards now answer the original questions:
- **"What did the factory do today?"** — Factory Today (v0.72.0)
- **"How much did it cost us?"** — Claude Cost & Usage (v0.73.0)
- **"What was our ROI?"** — Factory ROI (v0.74.0 — this release)

Six dashboards total in the bundle:
1. Factory Overview (hook events focused)
2. Claude Code Overview (Claude OTel log events)
3. Factory Today — Unified Activity
4. Factory PRs
5. Claude Cost & Usage
6. Factory ROI — Cost vs Output

### Added tests

- **`tests/factory-obs.bats`** — 6 new tests covering the ROI
  dashboard file, UID stability, derived-panel presence, and mixed-
  datasource transformation plumbing. Suite now at 79 tests.

### Verified

Dashboard loads in Grafana, joins the 6-dashboard list under the VSDD
Factory folder. Derived ratio panels render "N/A" until denominator
events appear (expected — the prism session hasn't produced commits
or PR merges in the current window yet). Cost-over-time timeseries
populated with real spend ($0.83+).

### Known gap — queued

Open→merge PR duration measurement requires LogQL pairing of
`pr.opened` and `pr.merged` events by `pr_number`. Backlog (see
project memory). Approach will likely mirror factory-sla's
agent-start/stop pairing.

### Migration

`factory-obs down && factory-obs up` (or `docker restart
vsdd-obs-grafana`) to pick up the new dashboard. No breaking changes.

## 0.73.1 — PR signal capture hook + cost dashboard metric name fixes + temporality fix

Big follow-up to v0.73.0. Closes backlog task #90 (richer PR signals
via direct Bash capture) and fixes two interacting issues that were
keeping the Claude Cost dashboard empty despite real Claude activity.

### Added

- **`hooks/capture-pr-activity.sh`** (new PostToolUse Bash hook) —
  watches for `gh pr create` and `gh pr merge` invocations and emits
  direct structured events when they succeed. No more inferring PR
  activity from subagent message text; the signal comes from the
  actual command.
  - `type=pr.opened` with fields: `pr_url`, `pr_number`, `pr_repo`,
    `title` (if `--title` flag present).
  - `type=pr.merged` with fields: `pr_url`, `pr_number`, `pr_repo`,
    `merge_strategy` (squash/rebase/merge from flag).
  - Catches PRs opened or merged *outside* the factory pr-manager
    workflow (e.g., human-driven merges).
  - Exit 0 always — advisory, never blocks. Filters on stdout URL
    presence + command-boundary regex match to avoid false positives
    (e.g., `echo "gh pr create is useful"` is correctly ignored).

- **`tests/capture-pr-activity.bats`** (new) — 15 bats tests covering
  create/merge paths, title extraction, merge-strategy flags, the
  positional-PR-number form (`gh pr merge 42`), regex
  tightness (echoed mentions don't match), failure-path no-ops, and
  graceful degradation when `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` or emit-event is
  missing.

- **Factory PRs dashboard** — new "PRs opened" stat panel (id 2). Top
  row resized to 5 × w=5 + 1 × w=4 to fit. "PRs merged" stat (id 3)
  and "PR workflows blocked / incomplete" (id 5) rebound to the new
  grid positions.

### Fixed

- **`skills/claude-telemetry/SKILL.md`** — telemetry `on` subcommand
  now writes a SIXTH env var:
  `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_TEMPORALITY_PREFERENCE=cumulative`.
  Without this, Claude's OTel SDK defaults to DELTA temporality, and
  the collector's `prometheusremotewrite` exporter rejects every sample
  with `invalid temporality and type combination` — dropping 7-11
  metrics per minute silently. The `deltatocumulative` processor that
  would do the conversion in-flight is not available in
  collector-contrib v0.94.0; normalizing at source is the only fix.

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/claude-cost.json`** —
  every metric-name query updated to match the real Prometheus
  surface, which includes unit suffixes between the metric name and
  the `_total` counter marker:
  - `claude_code_cost_usage_total` → `claude_code_cost_usage_USD_total`
  - `claude_code_token_usage_total` → `claude_code_token_usage_tokens_total`
  - `claude_code_active_time_total` → `claude_code_active_time_seconds_total`
  
  Verified live against the running Prometheus label index.

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-today.json`** and
  **`factory-prs.json`** — PRs-merged and PRs-opened queries now
  target the direct `event_type=pr.opened` / `event_type=pr.merged`
  labels instead of the inferred `hook=update-wave-state-on-merge`
  signal. More accurate for dashboard aggregation; the existing
  update-wave-state-on-merge hook continues doing its wave-state.yaml
  work untouched.

### Verified live

- New hook smoke-tested with manual JSON input; emits the correct
  event shape.
- Real Claude cost now visible in Prometheus: $0.83 today; token
  breakdown input=107, output=2610, cacheRead=1.2M, cacheCreation=26K.
  Cache hit ratio is excellent.
- All 73 bats tests pass (suite grew from 58 → 73 with the new
  hook's 15 cases).

### Migration

- Users with existing `claude-telemetry on` state: run
  `/vsdd-factory:claude-telemetry on` again to write the new sixth
  env var, then **restart your Claude Code session**. Without the
  restart, metrics continue to get dropped.
- `factory-obs down && factory-obs up` (or `docker restart
  vsdd-obs-grafana`) to reload dashboard provisioning.

### Known gap — queued for follow-up

- Open→merge duration needs LogQL pairing of `pr.opened` and
  `pr.merged` events by `pr_number`. Non-trivial in LogQL; likely
  needs a factory-sla-style pairing tool. Queued.

## 0.73.0 — Claude Cost & Usage dashboard (Phase B of cost/ROI series)

## 0.73.0 — Claude Cost & Usage dashboard (Phase B of cost/ROI series)

Phase B of the three-phase cost-and-ROI build-out. Uses the Prometheus
infrastructure laid in v0.72.0 to answer "how much did Claude cost us?"
with real dollar figures from Claude's OTel cost metric. ROI dashboard
lands next in Phase C.

### Added

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/claude-cost.json`** — new
  "Claude Cost & Usage" dashboard, 12 Prometheus-backed panels:
  - Top stats (5): Total cost (USD), Sessions, Input tokens, Output
    tokens, Cache hit ratio (0-1 gauge).
  - Cost timeseries by model — spotting which model drives cost.
  - Cost by model (donut pie) + Token usage by type (horizontal bar
    chart, input/output/cacheRead/cacheCreation).
  - Output-count stats (4): Lines added, Commits via Claude, Active
    session time, Cost per commit (derived).
  - All stats use `noValue: "0"` / `"N/A"` so empty ranges render
    cleanly.

### Metrics referenced

Documented Claude metric surface as translated to Prometheus (dots →
underscores, counters → `_total`):

- `claude_code_cost_usage_total` (USD; model / query_source / speed / effort)
- `claude_code_token_usage_total` (tokens; type / model / ...)
- `claude_code_session_count_total`
- `claude_code_lines_of_code_count_total` (by type added/removed)
- `claude_code_commit_count_total`
- `claude_code_active_time_total` (seconds)

Full metric shape captured in the project's Claude-OTel reference
memory for future dashboard work.

### `claude_code.pull_request.count` distinction

Claude emits this counter for PRs created via its `/install-github-app`
feature — NOT the factory's `pr-manager` subagent dispatches tracked
on the Factory PRs dashboard. Different concepts; dashboards do not
correlate them.

### Verified

`claude-cost.json` parses; all 12 panels reference the Prometheus
datasource (`uid: prometheus`); metric-name assertions pass in the
58-test bats suite. End-to-end data flow was verified in v0.72.0 via
a synthetic OTLP push — dashboard ships empty and populates as real
Claude activity accumulates.

### Migration

`factory-obs down && factory-obs up` to reload the dashboard
provisioning. Dashboard appears under the "VSDD Factory" folder in
Grafana alongside the other four.

### Next: Phase C (ROI)

Will cross-reference factory output signals (PRs merged, wave gates
passed, agent exit classes) with cost data to produce "cost per X"
views. Depends on richer PR signals (backlog) for the X to be
meaningful.

## 0.72.5 — Fix broken gauge query on Factory PRs dashboard

Factory PRs shipped in v0.72.3 with a Completion Ratio gauge whose
LogQL query was malformed. The query tried `1 - (blocked/dispatched)`
to invert the ratio, but LogQL doesn't accept a scalar on the left
of a top-level binary operation. Grafana rendered
`parse error at line 1, col 1: syntax error: unexpected IDENTIFIER`.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-prs.json`** —
  - Renamed "Completion ratio" → "Incomplete rate" (panel id 4).
    Semantics flipped: low is good (0 = every dispatch finished all
    10 steps), high is bad (1 = every dispatch blocked before step
    10). Color thresholds inverted accordingly: green/yellow/red at
    0 / 0.3 / 0.7.
  - Query rewritten as `blocked / dispatched` — pure vector/vector
    division, LogQL-compatible. Verified live with real data: returns
    `0.5` for the current state (1 blocked / 2 dispatched).
  - `noValue: "0"` added so fresh installs with no PR activity render
    "0%" instead of "No data".

### Why not just fix the subtraction?

LogQL does support binary operations between two aggregated queries,
but not with a literal scalar on the left at top level. Possible
rewrites that work:
- `(dispatched - blocked) / dispatched`
- `scalar(blocked) / scalar(dispatched)` wrapped differently

Both are more fragile than just showing the blocked ratio directly.
"Incomplete rate" is the same information with cleaner semantics and
a simpler query.

### Migration

Restart Grafana or `factory-obs down && up`. Browser may cache the
old dashboard — hard-reload if the panel still shows the error.

## 0.72.4 — Stat panels show "0" instead of "No data" for zero counts

User-reported: the "PRs merged" stat on Factory Today rendered
"No data" even when the answer was unambiguously "zero PRs merged
today." Grafana treats a Loki `count_over_time` that returns no
matching streams as null, and null → "No data" by default. But a
zero-count is a meaningful observation, not missing data — the
display should say "0."

### Fixed

- All stat panels across `factory-overview.json`,
  `factory-today.json`, `factory-prs.json`, and `claude-overview.json`
  now set `fieldConfig.defaults.noValue: "0"`. Zero-result queries
  render as "0" instead of "No data", making the semantic
  distinction honest: "we know the count is zero" vs. "the query
  errored / no data exists."

Doesn't affect gauge, bargauge, or logs panels — only stat panels,
which have a binary "show a number" mode where zero-vs-null
ambiguity matters.

### Migration

Restart Grafana or `factory-obs down && up` to pick up the dashboard
changes. No query or data-model changes.

## 0.72.3 — Factory PRs dashboard + Factory Today cross-reference

Dedicated dashboard for PR workflow signals, built on the events we
already capture. Complements Factory Today (general activity) and
feeds the upcoming cost/ROI story in Phases B and C.

### Added

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-prs.json`** — new
  "Factory PRs" dashboard at URL path `factory-prs`, 7 panels:
  - PR workflows dispatched (stat) — `agent.start` events with
    `attributes_subagent="vsdd-factory:pr-manager"`
  - PR workflows blocked / incomplete (stat) — `pr-manager-completion-guard`
    block events
  - PRs merged (stat) — `update-wave-state-on-merge` hook events
  - Completion ratio (gauge) — approximate, 1 - (blocked / dispatched)
  - PR workflow activity timeline (timeseries)
  - Where PR workflows stall (bargauge) — distribution of `attributes_last_step`
    from completion-guard blocks; shows which of the 10 PR workflow
    steps the pr-manager is most likely to stop at
  - Recent PR workflow events (logs) — filtered to pr-manager activity

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-today.json`** — new
  "PRs merged" stat panel (id 10) in the top row, so the top-line
  number appears on the daily overview without needing to switch
  dashboards. Top-row stats resized from `w=6 × 4` to `w=5 × 4 + w=4`
  to fit.

- **`tests/factory-obs.bats`** — 7 new tests covering the PRs
  dashboard file, UID stability, panel count, Loki-only queries, and
  the cross-reference stat on Factory Today. Suite now 52 tests.

### Backlog items captured (not shipped here)

Two signal-coverage gaps surfaced during build that are deferred to
after Phase B (cost) and Phase C (ROI):
1. Richer PR instrumentation — explicit "PR opened" events (new hook
   on `gh pr create` Bash invocations), PR URL/number capture, paired
   open-to-merge duration. Needed to make "cost per PR" truly
   meaningful.
2. Per-subagent usage dashboard — ranked panel showing every subagent
   type by invocation count, avg duration, and exit class mix. Uses
   existing `agent.start` / `agent.stop` events.

### Migration

Restart Grafana or `factory-obs down && up` to load the new dashboard.
The PRs-merged stat on Factory Today will populate as soon as the
`update-wave-state-on-merge` hook fires in any instrumented worktree.

## 0.72.2 — Factory Today bargauge number + label correctness

Two follow-on fixes for the Factory Today dashboard based on live
review. The panels were showing wildly inflated numbers (e.g.,
`block-ai-attribution = 214` when Loki had only 1 event for that hook)
and the Top Tools / Stories panels weren't showing their bar labels.

### Root causes

1. **Inflated counts**: all bargauge panels used
   `"reduceOptions.calcs": ["sum"]`. Grafana range queries against Loki
   emit a time series of evaluations — each bucket at time T re-runs
   `count_over_time([$__range])` and returns the range-wide count. With
   `sum` as the reducer, the panel summed ~180 buckets × actual_count,
   inflating each bar by 100-200×. Stat panels don't have this issue
   because they use `lastNotNull`, which takes the most recent bucket
   (which IS the actual range-wide count).

2. **Missing tool / story labels**: the Top Hooks panel renders labels
   correctly because it groups by `hook` — a promoted Loki stream label
   (via the `loki.resource.labels` hint added in v0.70.2). Top Tools
   and Stories group by `attributes_tool_name` and `attributes_story_id`
   — fields extracted at query time via `| json`. Grafana's bargauge
   shows real stream labels automatically but needs an explicit
   `displayName` override to surface query-extracted fields.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-today.json`** —
  - All three bargauge panels (Top Hooks, Top Tools, Stories): changed
    `reduceOptions.calcs` from `["sum"]` to `["lastNotNull"]`. Bar
    values now match the actual event counts in Loki.
  - Top Tools panel: added
    `fieldConfig.defaults.displayName: "${__field.labels.attributes_tool_name}"`
    so bars render with the tool name instead of the full label set.
  - Stories panel: same pattern with `attributes_story_id`.

### Verified live

Reloaded the dashboard after applying the fix. Numbers now align with
`wc -l .factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` and with direct Loki queries.
Stories panel shows `S-1.07` as its bar label; Tools shows `Bash`.

### Migration

Restart Grafana or `factory-obs down && up` to reload the dashboard
JSON. No data changes — only visual correctness.

## 0.72.1 — Fix Factory Today stories panel + metrics pipeline verified

Follow-up to v0.72.0. Same class of bug as v0.71.0's Claude-dashboard
queries: field name mismatch between the raw event JSON and Loki's
`| json` flattened output.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-today.json`** —
  stories-touched query now uses `attributes_story_id` (Loki's
  flattened form), not bare `story_id`. Verified live: returns
  `S-1.07 = 2` against today's prism activity.

### Verified

- **Metrics pipeline end-to-end**: synthetic OTLP push to
  `http://localhost:4318/v1/metrics` → HTTP 200 → metric appeared in
  Prometheus as `claude_code_token_usage_synthetic_total` within
  seconds. The empty Prometheus state in a fresh install is purely a
  "no Claude session actively emitting" artifact, not a wiring bug.

- **Top tools (Claude) panel**: working as designed. Renders a single
  large bar when Claude has used only one tool (Bash) in the range;
  the tool name label sits left of the bar and can crop at narrow
  window widths.

### Migration

Restart Grafana or `factory-obs down && up` to pick up the dashboard
fix.

## 0.72.0 — Prometheus + Factory Today dashboard (Phase A of cost/ROI series)

Phase A of the three-phase cost-and-ROI observability build-out. Lays
the metrics-storage foundation (Prometheus) and ships the first new
dashboard (unified daily activity view). Cost dashboard lands in
v0.72.1; ROI in v0.72.2.

### Added

- **`tools/observability/prometheus-config.yaml`** — minimal Prometheus
  config. Acts as a remote_write sink only; no scrape jobs beyond a
  self-scrape. 30-day retention set on the command line in compose.

- **`tools/observability/docker-compose.yml`** — new `prometheus`
  service (`prom/prometheus:v2.54.0`), port 9090 (env-overridable via
  `VSDD_OBS_PROMETHEUS_PORT`). Started with
  `--web.enable-remote-write-receiver` so the collector can push
  metrics over OTLP. Health-checked. `otel-collector` and `grafana`
  both depend on it being healthy before starting — prevents the
  collector's first push getting a connection-refused.

- **`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`** — new
  `prometheusremotewrite` exporter pushing to
  `http://prometheus:9090/api/v1/write`.
  `resource_to_telemetry_conversion.enabled: true` so resource
  attributes (`service.name`, session id, model) surface as labels on
  every metric. Metrics pipeline now exports to both Prometheus AND
  the existing `debug` exporter — stdout visibility retained alongside
  persistence.

- **`tools/observability/grafana-provisioning/datasources/prometheus.yaml`** —
  Prometheus datasource with pinned `uid: prometheus` (same convention
  as the loki datasource).

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-today.json`** —
  unified daily activity dashboard. 9 panels, all Loki-backed
  (Prometheus-backed cost/ROI panels live on dedicated dashboards in
  v0.72.1+):
  - Events today (total across both streams)
  - Hook blocks (factory guards)
  - Tool calls (Claude)
  - Unique Claude sessions
  - Activity timeline stacked by `service_name`
  - Top hooks fired
  - Top tools used
  - Stories touched today (parsed from `agent.start.story_id`)
  - Recent significant events (`hook.block` + `hook.action`)

  Default time range is "today" (`now/d` to `now`) — wall-clock
  midnight-to-now rather than the typical rolling 24h window.

- **`bin/factory-obs`** — help text and `up` confirmation now mention
  Prometheus URL and `VSDD_OBS_PROMETHEUS_PORT`.

- **`tests/factory-obs.bats`** — 14 new tests covering the Prometheus
  service definition, collector wiring, datasource provisioning, and
  the factory-today dashboard. Total suite size now 45 tests.

### Verified live

Stack restarted against prism's active event stream; confirmed all four
containers healthy, both datasources provisioned, Prometheus
remote_write accepting pushes (invalid-samples counter = 0), collector
emitting no errors. Claude metrics populate on next Claude-session
activity (metrics batch on a 60s default interval).

### Migration

Existing installs: `factory-obs down && factory-obs up` to pick up the
new service. First start pulls the Prometheus image (~250MB). If port
9090 is in use, set `VSDD_OBS_PROMETHEUS_PORT=<alternate>` before `up`.

No breaking changes. Logs-to-Loki continues working even if Prometheus
is down — pipelines are independent.

## 0.71.1 — Claude dashboard queries fixed against real Claude OTel shape

v0.71.0 shipped the `claude-overview.json` dashboard with queries based
on docs-level assumptions about Claude Code's OTel shape. Real data
showed the shape differs: Claude emits attribute keys with dots
(`attributes.session.id`, `attributes.event.name`, `attributes.tool_name`),
and Loki's `| json` operator flattens them with underscores
(`attributes_session_id`, `attributes_event_name`, `attributes_tool_name`).
Queries that assumed bare `session_id` / `tool_name` returned empty.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/claude-overview.json`** —
  queries now use the flattened attribute paths Loki actually produces:
  - Panel 2 (Unique sessions): `attributes_session_id` — resolved to 2.
  - Panel 3 (Tool invocations): filters on
    `attributes_event_name = "tool_result"` — resolved to 2.
  - Panel 4 (API requests): filters on
    `attributes_event_name = "api_request"` — resolved to 3.
  - Panel 5 (Events over time): breakdown by `attributes_event_name`.
  - Panel 6 (Top tools): `attributes_tool_name` — resolved to Bash = 3.

Verified live against real prism-session Claude data.

### Event names observed in real Claude data (v2.1.118)

For reference when building future dashboards:
`user_prompt`, `api_request`, `api_response`, `tool_result`,
`tool_decision`, `hook_execution_start`, `hook_execution_complete`,
`mcp_server_connection`.

Memory reference `claude-code-otel-reference` updated with the full
attribute shape.

### Migration

Restart Grafana (or `factory-obs down && up`) to pick up the corrected
dashboard JSON.

## 0.71.0 — Claude dashboard + CI parity check + release script

Bundles three pieces of release-hygiene + observability work that have
been on the backlog since the v0.68.1/v0.69.0 release-workflow incident
and v0.69.0's introduction of Claude OTel ingestion without a matching
dashboard:

1. **CI parity check** — the missing gate that would have caught v0.68.1
   and v0.69.0 before tag push.
2. **`scripts/bump-version.sh`** — atomic release helper so the lockstep
   rule (plugin.json ↔ marketplace.json ↔ CHANGELOG) can't be forgotten
   by accident.
3. **`claude-overview.json` Grafana dashboard** — first-pass dashboard
   for the `claude-code` service pipeline wired in v0.69.0. Queries
   don't assume Claude's full label schema yet — they use `| json`
   parsing so they work against whatever structured-metadata shape
   Claude's OTel SDK produces.

### Added

- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — new step `Verify version parity across
  plugin.json and marketplace.json`. Runs on every push to main + PRs.
  Fails fast with an actionable message pointing at
  `scripts/bump-version.sh` if `plugin.json.version` and
  `marketplace.json.plugins[0].version` drift. This catches the failure
  mode that bit v0.68.1 (silent Release workflow failure on tag push)
  at the earliest possible moment — on the commit that introduces the
  drift, not at the tag two commits later.

- **`scripts/bump-version.sh`** — one-command version bump that updates
  plugin.json, marketplace.json, and prepends a CHANGELOG heading stub
  with today's date. Validates semver format. Refuses to run if either
  version file has uncommitted changes (prevents clobbering
  work-in-progress). Does **not** commit or tag — the operator reviews
  the diff and stages manually. This release dogfoods the script.

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/claude-overview.json`** —
  new Grafana dashboard at URL path `claude-code-overview`, auto-
  provisioned under the "VSDD Factory" folder. Seven panels:
  - Total events (Claude)
  - Unique sessions (parsed from `session_id` via `| json`)
  - Tool invocations (matches `tool_result` in body)
  - API requests (matches `api_request` in body)
  - Events over time
  - Top tools used (top 10 by `tool_name`)
  - Recent events (last 50, raw log)
  
  Queries are intentionally forgiving — only `service_name` is assumed
  to be a promoted Loki label; everything else goes through `| json` so
  the panels work whatever label schema Claude's SDK produces. Tune to
  promoted labels later once real data accumulates.

### Migration

No breaking changes. The new dashboard auto-provisions on next
`factory-obs up`. Existing installs may need `factory-obs down && up`
to pick up the new `claude-overview.json` file if Grafana's dashboard
provider doesn't hot-reload for them.

To see Claude telemetry in the new dashboard:
1. `factory-obs up`
2. `/vsdd-factory:claude-telemetry on`
3. Restart your Claude Code session so env vars load.

## 0.70.3 — Blocks (hard) threshold: yellow at 1+, red at 10+

Cosmetic tweak to the bundled `factory-overview` dashboard. Previously
any non-zero count in the `Blocks (hard)` stat panel turned it red,
which over-reacted to routine hook fires like `block-ai-attribution`
(normal during AI-assisted commits). New threshold scheme distinguishes
"some expected activity" from "unusual volume worth investigating":

- `0` → green
- `1-9` → yellow (expected during active sessions)
- `10+` → red (elevated, investigate)

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/grafana-dashboards/factory-overview.json`** —
  `Blocks (hard)` panel thresholds updated. No query change; just the
  color mapping. Other panels (`Blocks (warn)`, `Actions`, `Total
  events`) unchanged.

### Migration

Dashboard is provisioned from this JSON on Grafana startup. Existing
installs need `factory-obs down && factory-obs up` to reload the
dashboard file (or `factory-obs reset` if other state is stale).

## 0.70.2 — Loki label hint: move to a log-record processor (fixes v0.70.1)

v0.70.1 placed the `loki.resource.labels` hint on the `resource`
processor — which silently did nothing. The Loki exporter reads that
hint off the **log record's** attributes, not the resource's. Verified
live against the running stack: before this fix, Loki labels were
only `service_name`, `exporter`, `job`. After this fix, new events
ship with the full set — `event_type`, `hook`, `reason`, `severity`
— and the dashboard's filter panels resolve.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`** — introduced a
  new `attributes/loki-label-hint` processor (log-record scope) that
  sets `loki.resource.labels` on each log record. Wired into the
  hook-events pipeline after `resource` and before `loki` export.
  Removed the dead hint from the `resource` processor. Verified
  label-promotion works in Loki exporter v0.94.0.

### Migration

Existing installs need `factory-obs down && factory-obs up` to reload
config. Events ingested under v0.70.1 (or earlier) are stuck as
structured metadata — Loki doesn't retroactively relabel chunks. If
the old `No data` panels need to clear, `factory-obs reset` wipes the
Loki volume; `.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` remains the source of
truth and the collector re-ingests with correct labels on next start.

## 0.70.1 — Promote `event_type` / `hook` / `reason` / `severity` to Loki labels

Completes the dashboard-resolution work started in v0.69.2. With the
service.name fix applied, the `Total events` and `Recent events` panels
started working (confirmed via a screenshot showing 66 events). But
the filter panels — `Blocks (hard)`, `Blocks (warn)`, `Actions`,
`Events over time (by type)`, `Top block reasons`, `Blocks by hook` —
all still showed "No data" because their LogQL queries use
`event_type`, `hook`, `reason`, and `severity` as Loki **labels** in
stream selectors and `by()` groupings, but the collector was storing
them as **structured metadata**. Different syntax; the queries found
nothing.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`** — added the
  `loki.resource.labels` hint (`"event_type, hook, reason, severity"`)
  on the `resource` processor. This is the documented Loki-exporter
  mechanism for promoting resource attributes to stream labels.
  Cardinality is bounded: ~4 event_types × ~40 hooks × ~70 reasons ×
  ~4 severities keeps local Loki comfortable.

The `resource/claude` processor is deliberately NOT touched — Claude's
native telemetry has its own attribute shape and shouldn't be forced
into our label schema.

### Migration

Existing installs need `factory-obs down && factory-obs up` for the
collector to reload config. Historical events in Loki stay as
structured metadata under their old streams (Loki doesn't re-label
historical chunks); new events start flowing with the promoted labels
immediately. Run `factory-obs reset` if you want a clean slate —
`.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` remains the source of truth.

## 0.70.0 — Worktree-aware log dir: events aggregate into main repo's `.factory/logs/`

Previously, hooks running inside a git worktree wrote their events to
`<worktree>/.factory/logs/`, so the activity stream fragmented across
every linked worktree. If the observability stack was started from
inside a worktree, it tailed only that one worktree's events — and
other worktrees' activity was invisible. Debugging this consumed real
time (prism's main repo had 4 events; its active worktree had 95).

This release fixes the fragmentation by making every event-producing
and event-consuming tool resolve to the **main worktree's**
`.factory/logs/` by default.

### Changed

- **`bin/emit-event`** — resolves the main worktree via
  `git worktree list --porcelain | awk '/^worktree /{print $2; exit}'`
  (first entry is always the main worktree). Events from any linked
  worktree now land in `<main-worktree>/.factory/logs/`. Explicit
  `VSDD_LOG_DIR` still wins; fallback to cwd's `.factory/logs/` if
  git is unavailable or cwd isn't a repo.

- **`bin/factory-query`**, **`bin/factory-report`**, **`bin/factory-replay`**,
  **`bin/factory-sla`** — same resolution so queries see the unified
  event stream from every worktree regardless of which one you're
  sitting in.

- **`bin/factory-dashboard`** — when `--factory PATH` is passed
  explicitly, log resolution honors that path (caller scoped the run).
  When `--factory` is default, uses the main-worktree resolution. This
  preserves the existing escape hatch.

- **`bin/factory-obs`** — the Docker stack now mounts the main
  worktree's `.factory/logs/` by default, so the collector tails the
  aggregated stream. Restart required: `factory-obs down && up`.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/emit-event.bats`** — 3 new tests covering the resolution
  matrix: `VSDD_LOG_DIR` explicit override wins; main-worktree
  resolution fires inside a git worktree; graceful fallback to cwd
  when git is unavailable. Each test builds a temp repo + worktree
  via `git worktree add` so it doesn't rely on the surrounding
  repo's state.

### Migration

Existing installs need a one-time migration to see the aggregated
stream:

```bash
# Stop the stack, then rebind to the main worktree's logs
factory-obs down
cd <main-repo-root>  # or simply re-run `factory-obs up` from any worktree
factory-obs up
```

Historical events in `<worktree>/.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` files
are not moved automatically — they stay where they are. If you want
them aggregated, copy or symlink them into
`<main-repo>/.factory/logs/` before starting the stack (the filelog
receiver will ingest them like any other event file).

Setting `VSDD_LOG_DIR` or `VSDD_FACTORY_LOGS` preserves the pre-v0.70
behavior for anyone who needs per-worktree isolation. The fallback to
cwd for non-git directories is unchanged.

## 0.69.2 — Observability stack: fix service.name label so dashboards resolve

Patch release. Fixes a silent-data bug in the local observability stack
that has been present since v0.66.0: all hook events land in Loki with
the label `service_name=unknown_service` instead of
`service_name=vsdd-factory`, so every panel in the bundled
`factory-overview` dashboard returns "No data" even though events are
flowing through the collector correctly.

### Root cause

`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml` set the resource
attribute key as `service_name` (underscore). The Loki exporter's label
promotion rule looks for `service.name` (dotted — the OTel semantic
convention). When it doesn't find the dotted key, it falls back to
`service_name=unknown_service` as the Loki label. Our underscore
attribute was still emitted, but as structured metadata inside the log
body — not as a queryable Loki label.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`** — both `resource`
  and `resource/claude` processors now set `service.name` (dotted) with
  `upsert`. Hook events now land with
  `{service_name="vsdd-factory"}` and Claude's native telemetry with
  `{service_name="claude-code"}`.

### Migration

Existing installs must `factory-obs down && factory-obs up` to reload
the collector config. Data already in Loki under `unknown_service`
remains there (Loki doesn't re-label historical chunks), but new events
will land under the correct label immediately. If you want the old
data to disappear, also run `factory-obs reset` — this wipes Loki's
volume, which is fine for local-dev observability since events are
authoritative in `.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl`.

## 0.69.1 — Release workflow fix: sync marketplace.json version

Patch release. Unblocks the GitHub Release workflow, which has been
silently failing on every tag push since v0.68.1 because
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` was not bumped alongside
`plugins/vsdd-factory/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. The plugin itself
still installs correctly via the tag — only the Releases-page entry
was missing.

### Fixed

- **`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`** — bumped `plugins[0].version`
  from `0.68.0` to `0.69.1` to match `plugin.json`. The release
  workflow validates tag ↔ marketplace.json AND tag ↔ plugin.json;
  any drift fails the job and skips the GitHub Release creation step.

### Process note

Future releases MUST bump all three version fields in lockstep:
- `plugins/vsdd-factory/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — plugin itself
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — marketplace entry
- `CHANGELOG.md` — new section heading

No v0.68.1 / v0.69.0 GitHub Release entries will be backfilled; the
tags remain the source of truth and installs continue to work
unchanged.

## 0.69.0 — Claude Code native telemetry → factory observability stack

Turns the local observability stack into a two-stream feed. Hook events
(`service_name=vsdd-factory`) remain the interpretation layer. Claude
Code's native OpenTelemetry export (`service_name=claude-code`) now
flows into the same Loki, giving a complete "what did the factory do
today?" activity feed — every tool call, token count, and API event —
without requiring us to instrument more hooks.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/grafana-provisioning/datasources/loki.yaml`** —
  pinned the Loki datasource UID to `loki`. Without this, Grafana
  auto-generates a random UID, and the bundled `factory-overview`
  dashboard (which references the datasource by `"uid": "loki"` in all
  16 panels) errors with "datasource loki not found" on every panel.
  Affects existing installs; users should run `factory-obs reset &&
  factory-obs up` to re-provision the datasource with the pinned UID.

### Added

- **`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`** — added an `otlp`
  receiver (HTTP on 4318, gRPC on 4317) and three new pipelines:
  - `logs/claude` — Claude Code OTel logs → Loki, tagged
    `service_name=claude-code` via a new `resource/claude` processor.
    Query in Grafana with `{service_name="claude-code"}`.
  - `metrics` — Claude's metrics → `debug` exporter (basic verbosity,
    no persistent backend). Pipelines must exist or the OTLP receiver
    rejects the signal type. Swap for Prometheus if metrics querying
    becomes important.
  - `traces` — symmetric to metrics, opt-in on Claude's side.

- **`skills/claude-telemetry/SKILL.md`** + **`commands/claude-telemetry.md`** —
  new `/vsdd-factory:claude-telemetry` slash command with three
  subcommands:
  - `on` (default) — writes five OTEL env vars
    (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY`, `OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER`,
    `OTEL_LOGS_EXPORTER`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL`,
    `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`) into
    `.claude/settings.local.json` under the `env` block via `jq` merge.
    Preserves all other `env` entries and top-level keys.
  - `off` — removes exactly those five keys and deletes `env` if empty.
  - `status` — prints which of the five keys are currently set.
  
  Reversible, per-project, respects `settings.local.json` (gitignored
  per convention). `disable-model-invocation: true` — fires on explicit
  request only, matching the `factory-obs` / `activate` pattern for
  configuration side-effects.

### Defaults and rationale

- Protocol is pinned to `http/protobuf` because `docker-compose.yml`
  only host-exposes port 4318. Users who want gRPC can remap 4317 and
  override `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` manually.
- Endpoint is `http://localhost:4318`. If `VSDD_OBS_OTLP_HTTP_PORT` is
  remapped in compose, users override the endpoint manually — the skill
  does not read environment variables from the factory-obs layer
  because the skill writes to user settings, not collector settings.
- The skill does **not** toggle sensitive-content gates
  (`OTEL_LOG_USER_PROMPTS`, `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_DETAILS`, `OTEL_LOG_TOOL_CONTENT`).
  Users who want those must add them manually. The skill's
  documentation calls this out explicitly with a privacy note.

### Migration

No breaking changes. Installs on v0.68.x continue to work — the new
OTLP receiver and pipelines are additive. To start using Claude's
native telemetry:

1. `factory-obs up` — ensure the stack is current and accepting OTLP.
2. `/vsdd-factory:claude-telemetry on` — write the env vars.
3. Restart your Claude Code session.
4. Query in Grafana with `{service_name="claude-code"}`.

If you're upgrading from <v0.69.0 and your collector container was
started against the old config, recreate it: `factory-obs down && factory-obs up`.

## 0.68.1 — Observability stack: first-run fixes + /factory-obs skill

Two shippable fixes found while smoke-testing `factory-obs up` on a clean
machine, plus a convenience skill so the stack can be driven from a slash
command.

### Fixed

- **`tools/observability/docker-compose.yml`** — the otel-collector crashed
  with `permission denied` on `/var/lib/otelcol/receiver_filelog_` on first
  run. The `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.94.0` image runs as UID
  10001, but Docker creates the `collector-state` named volume root-owned,
  so the collector couldn't persist its filelog offsets and entered a
  crash loop. Added `user: "0:0"` to the otel-collector service. This is a
  local-only dev stack and the volume is isolated from the host, so it
  doesn't grant host privileges.

- **`tools/observability/otel-collector-config.yaml`** — the `move`
  operators for `attributes.hook` and `attributes.reason` threw
  `field does not exist` errors on events that don't carry those fields
  (`agent.start`, `agent.stop`). Added `if: 'attributes.X != nil'` guards
  matching the pattern already used for `severity`. Errors are gone from
  collector logs; hook.block / hook.action events continue to promote
  `hook` and `reason` to resource attributes as before.

### Added

- **`skills/factory-obs/SKILL.md`** + **`commands/factory-obs.md`** — new
  `/vsdd-factory:factory-obs` slash command. Accepts the same subcommand
  surface as the binary (`up` / `down` / `reset` / `status` / `logs` /
  `dashboard` / `help`) and defaults to `up` when called with no args.
  `disable-model-invocation: true` — only fires on explicit user request,
  matching the `factory-dashboard` pattern for infrastructure commands
  that side-effect Docker.

### Migration

No breaking changes. Users who already have the stack running with the
old compose should run `factory-obs reset && factory-obs up` to recreate
the collector-state volume with the new `user:` directive. The reset
loses the collector's filelog read-offsets, so events already in the
`.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` files will be re-ingested (duplicates in
Loki for the short pre-reset window). Fresh installs are unaffected.

## 0.68.0 — Observability Phase 6.2: agent SLO tracking + factory-sla

Derives per-invocation subagent durations by pairing new `agent.start` and
`agent.stop` telemetry events. Also closes a test-side papercut where
`factory-obs dashboard` was opening a browser during BATS runs.

### Added

- **`hooks/track-agent-start.sh`** (PreToolUse on Agent matcher) — emits
  one `agent.start` event per subagent dispatch. Never blocks; exits 0
  on every path. Fields: `subagent`, `session_id` (auto from env),
  `story_id` (best-effort extracted from prompt).

- **`hooks/track-agent-stop.sh`** (SubagentStop, all agents) — emits one
  `agent.stop` event per subagent completion. Classifies `exit_class`
  into `ok` / `empty` / `blocked` from the subagent's result text.
  Fields: `subagent`, `session_id`, `exit_class`, `result_len`.

- **`bin/factory-sla`** — duration analysis CLI. Three subcommands:
  - `durations` — list each matched (start, stop) pair with
    session / subagent / timestamps / duration_sec / exit class /
    story_id. Flags: `--session`, `--subagent`, `--days`, `--limit`,
    `--tsv`.
  - `summary` — per-subagent aggregate: count, min, p50, p90, p99,
    max, mean (seconds).
  - `open` — starts without matching stops (in-flight or orphaned).

  Pairing rule: per `(session_id, subagent)` tuple, each `agent.stop`
  pairs with the most recent unpaired `agent.start`. Nested dispatches
  of the same subagent in one session stack correctly.

- **`emit-event`** — new `ts_epoch` field (Unix seconds) alongside `ts`.
  Additive schema change. Tools computing durations should prefer
  `ts_epoch` since tz-offset `ts` parsing varies across platforms.

### Fixed

- **`bin/factory-obs dashboard`** — no longer launches a browser in
  non-interactive contexts (BATS runs, CI). Gated by `[ -t 1 ]` TTY
  check, with an explicit `VSDD_OBS_OPEN_BROWSER` env var override
  (`1` forces, `0` suppresses, unset = auto). Tests now pass
  `VSDD_OBS_OPEN_BROWSER=0` explicitly.

  Side benefit: the dashboard URL was being opened even when the Docker
  stack wasn't running — browser would show connection-refused. The
  TTY gate prevents both issues.

### Changed

- **`hooks/hooks.json`** — wires the two new telemetry hooks into the
  Agent / SubagentStop matchers. They run alongside existing validators
  (wave-gate-prerequisite, pr-merge-prerequisites, handoff-validator,
  etc.), not replacing anything.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/agent-tracking.bats`** (new) — 14 tests: track-agent-start
  (emission on Agent, story_id extraction, non-Agent no-op,
  CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT resilience), track-agent-stop (emission,
  exit_class classification for ok/empty/blocked, resilience), and
  hooks.json wiring.

- **`tests/factory-sla.bats`** (new) — 21 tests: structural, durations
  with session/subagent filters, TSV output, exit class display,
  story_id propagation, summary percentile correctness, open-unmatched
  detection, empty-state graceful handling.

- **`tests/emit-event.bats`** — 1 new test (41 total) asserting
  `ts_epoch` is an integer in a sane range.

- 1073 tests across 35 suites, 0 failures.

### Deferred to Phase 6.3

- **Pipeline flame graphs** — would need a shift from logs-based
  emission to OTel tracing spans (parent/child relationships for nested
  subagent dispatches), plus adding Tempo to the Docker stack. Bigger
  architectural move; worth its own release.

## 0.67.0 — Observability Phase 6.1: session ID injection + factory-replay

Foundation for session-scoped analysis. Events now carry `session_id`
auto-injected from Claude Code's `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` env var, enabling
replay of what a specific session fired. Unblocks Phase 6.2 (agent SLOs)
and 6.3 (flame graphs) — both need session grouping to be meaningful.

### Changed

- **`bin/emit-event`** — auto-injects `session_id` field from env vars
  with priority order:
  1. Caller-provided `session_id=` arg (highest priority)
  2. `$VSDD_SESSION_ID` (test / override)
  3. `$CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` (Claude Code native env var)
  4. No session_id (event is orphan, still valid)

  Purely additive schema change. Events emitted before 0.67 lack
  `session_id` and simply group under `(no-session)` in replay views.

### Added

- **`bin/factory-replay`** — session replay CLI. Three subcommands:
  - `sessions [--days N] [--limit N] [--tsv]` — list distinct sessions
    with event count + first/last timestamps, sorted by recency.
  - `show <session_id> [--limit N]` — chronological playback of a
    specific session. Pass `(no-session)` to see orphan events.
  - `latest [--limit N]` — replay the most recent session with a
    session_id.

  Output is a readable ts / severity / hook / reason / context table.
  Gracefully handles missing log dir, empty log dir, and "only orphan
  events" cases.

### Updated (schema)

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — event schema table now includes
  the optional `session_id` field with priority rules.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/emit-event.bats`** — 5 new tests (40 total) covering
  session_id auto-injection priority: `VSDD_SESSION_ID` override,
  `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID` fallback, env-var precedence (VSDD wins), caller
  override beats env, absence when neither set.
- **`tests/factory-replay.bats`** (new) — 16 tests: subcommand
  structure, session listing + sort order, session filtering, orphan
  event handling, chronological ordering in `show`, latest with/without
  sessions, empty-state graceful handling.
- 1038 tests across 33 suites, 0 failures.

### Deferred to Phase 6.2 / 6.3

- Agent duration tracking — needs hooks at both PreToolUse Agent
  (dispatch) and SubagentStop (return), plus a correlation ID so start
  and end events can be paired. Planned for Phase 6.2.
- Flame graph visualization — needs OTel tracing spans, which means
  adding Tempo to the Docker stack and changing the emission layer
  from logs to traces. Bigger architectural shift. Planned for 6.3.

## 0.66.0 — Observability Phase 5: local Docker stack (Grafana dashboards)

The visual layer on top of the event log. Opt-in Docker stack that tails
`.factory/logs/events-*.jsonl` and renders preconfigured Grafana
dashboards. Three containers: OTel Collector, Loki, Grafana. No cloud
services, no telemetry leaves your machine.

### Added

- **`plugins/vsdd-factory/tools/observability/`** — ships with vsdd-factory:
  - `docker-compose.yml` — 3-service stack. Health-checked. Configurable
    ports via env vars. Default: Grafana 3000, Loki 3100, OTLP HTTP 4318.
  - `otel-collector-config.yaml` — `filelog` receiver tails
    `events-*.jsonl`, JSON-parses each line, promotes
    `type`/`hook`/`reason`/`severity` to resource attributes, exports
    to Loki. Uses the `file_storage` extension to track ingest offsets
    across restarts (no duplicate ingestion).
  - `grafana-provisioning/datasources/loki.yaml` — preconfigured Loki
    datasource.
  - `grafana-provisioning/dashboards/provider.yaml` — dashboard
    provisioning pointing at a mounted `/var/lib/grafana/dashboards`.
  - `grafana-dashboards/factory-overview.json` — starter dashboard with
    8 panels: total events / blocks (hard) / blocks (warn) / actions
    stat tiles, stacked time series of events by type, top-block-reasons
    table, blocks-by-hook bar gauge, and a live log stream.
  - `README.md` — quickstart, architecture diagram, troubleshooting,
    uninstall.

- **`bin/factory-obs`** — lifecycle CLI: `up` / `down` / `reset` / `status`
  / `logs` / `dashboard`. Auto-detects `docker compose` (v2 subcommand)
  or `docker-compose` (v1 binary). Sets `VSDD_FACTORY_LOGS` to the
  project's `.factory/logs/` if unset. `dashboard` prints the Grafana URL
  and opens the browser on macOS / Linux.

### Design decisions

- **Why not `grafana/otel-lgtm` single-container?** Separate services
  give us precise provisioning paths (Grafana provisioning APIs vary by
  distribution) and standard images that are well-documented. The
  overhead of one extra container is negligible compared to easier
  troubleshooting.
- **Why no Prometheus/metrics backend?** Loki's `count_over_time` covers
  every current visualization. If future dashboards need true time
  series (histograms, quantiles), Mimir can be added later without
  breaking anything.
- **Why anonymous admin access in Grafana?** Deliberate — this stack is
  local-only dev. The README flags what to change if exposing beyond
  localhost.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/factory-obs.bats`** (new) — 32 tests. Verifies script syntax
  + help + error paths (no Docker required), compose file structure
  (services / images / dependencies / volume mounts / ports), collector
  config (receivers / exporters / pipelines), Grafana provisioning YAML,
  and dashboard JSON (parseable, stable UID, all panels reference Loki,
  every target has an expr).

  End-to-end Docker runs are intentionally NOT tested in CI — BATS
  environments often don't have Docker and starting real containers in
  tests is flaky. Full validation is per the README's "testing without
  docker" section.

- 1006 tests across 32 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — new "factory-obs + Docker stack"
  section describing the opt-in flow; roadmap marks Phase 5 shipped.

### What's next

- **Phase 6** — Session replay from the event log, agent SLO tracking,
  pipeline flame graphs. Some parts (replay) can layer on top of
  `factory-query` without Docker; others (flame graphs) benefit from
  Tempo, which could be added to the stack as a future release.

## 0.65.0 — Observability Phase 4: /factory-dashboard slash command

Live pipeline dashboard as a single command. Combines STATE.md, wave-state.yaml,
and the event log into one markdown view.

### Added

- **`bin/factory-dashboard`** — shell script that produces a markdown
  pipeline dashboard. Sections:
  - Project metadata (phase, mode, status, current step, STATE.md size
    with >200/>500-line warnings)
  - Waves table (each wave with gate status glyph, merged/total stories,
    next-gate marker)
  - Recent activity (factory-query stats + top-5 block reasons for the
    lookback window)
  - Pending wave gates (scraped from the most recent log's
    `pending_wave_gate_at_session_end` events)
  - Health checks (✓/✗ for each data source)

  Every section handles "missing" gracefully — no STATE.md, no
  wave-state.yaml, no event log, missing `python3` (falls back cleanly)
  all produce clean notices rather than errors.

- **`skills/factory-dashboard/SKILL.md`** + **`commands/factory-dashboard.md`**
  — slash command `/vsdd-factory:factory-dashboard` invokes the script.

### Naming

Chose `factory-dashboard` to avoid collision with the pre-existing
`factory-health` skill (which validates the `.factory/` worktree
structure — different purpose). The two complement each other:
- `/vsdd-factory:factory-health` — is the worktree set up correctly?
- `/vsdd-factory:factory-dashboard` — what's the pipeline doing right now?

### Flags

- `--factory PATH` — point at an alternate `.factory/` (e.g., a second
  project opened in the same session).
- `--days N` — change the event-log lookback window (default 7).

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/factory-dashboard.bats`** (new) — 16 tests covering:
  structural checks, empty state, STATE-only state, wave-state parsing
  (including malformed YAML graceful degradation), event integration,
  health-check glyphs, size-threshold warnings, and both flags.
- 974 tests across 31 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — new section on
  `/factory-dashboard` with usage examples and a note clarifying its
  distinction from `/factory-health`; roadmap marks Phase 4 shipped.

### What's next

- **Phase 5** — Opt-in Docker observability stack (Grafana LGTM
  single-container) with preconfigured dashboards.
- **Phase 6** — Session replay, agent SLO tracking, pipeline flame graphs.

## 0.64.0 — Observability Phase 3: factory-query + factory-report CLIs

First shipped tooling on top of the event log. Two new binaries query
and summarize the structured events accumulated by instrumented hooks.

### Added

- **`bin/factory-query`** — canned queries against the event log. Six
  subcommands:
  - `top [--days N] [--limit N] [--tsv]` — top block reasons and hooks.
  - `recent [--limit N] [--severity warn|block|any] [--type T] [--tsv]`
    — latest events with optional filters. Action events display as
    `severity=action` to distinguish from block/warn.
  - `grep <reason_code>` — emit matching events as JSONL.
  - `hooks [--days N] [--tsv]` — block counts per hook.
  - `stats [--days N]` — aggregate: total / blocks (hard/warn) / actions /
    unique reasons / unique hooks / log file count / first & last dates.
  - `reasons [--days N] [--tsv]` — every unique (type, severity, hook,
    reason) combination with counts.

  All subcommands default to human-readable aligned tables; `--tsv`
  produces pipe-friendly output. `--days N` filters by log file date
  stamp (portable — avoids `date -d` / `date -v` syntax differences).

- **`bin/factory-report`** — markdown summaries. Three subcommands:
  - `daily [--date YYYY-MM-DD]` — single-day summary (default: today).
  - `weekly [--end YYYY-MM-DD]` — trailing 7-day summary ending at today
    (or explicit end date).
  - `range --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD` — arbitrary date range.

  Each report contains: summary totals, top block reasons table, hook
  activity table, wave merges table (if any `wave_merge_recorded` events
  in range), and session-end gate warnings table (if any). Output is
  clean markdown — paste directly into PRs or Slack, or pipe through
  `glow`/`mdcat` for rendered terminal output.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/factory-query.bats`** (new) — 21 tests. Covers all
  subcommands, flag combinations, empty log dir, missing log dir,
  date filtering, TSV format, and action-type severity labeling.
- **`tests/factory-report.bats`** (new) — 17 tests. Covers daily /
  weekly / range variants, markdown structure, all section types,
  empty states, and argument validation.
- 958 tests across 30 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — new "Querying logs" section with
  examples for both CLIs; roadmap marks Phase 3 shipped.

### Notes

- Both CLIs are read-only. They never write to the log or to `.factory/`.
- Both gracefully handle missing log dir, no events, and unparseable
  events (jq silently skips malformed lines).
- No new external dependencies beyond `jq` (already required by hooks).

### What's next

- **Phase 4** — `/factory-health` slash command: live pipeline dashboard
  from `STATE.md` + `wave-state.yaml` + recent events.
- **Phase 5** — Opt-in Docker observability stack (Grafana LGTM
  single-container) with preconfigured dashboards.
- **Phase 6** — Session replay, agent SLO tracking, pipeline flame graphs.

## 0.63.0 — Observability Phase 2e: instrument SubagentStop + Stop hooks (Phase 2 COMPLETE)

**Phase 2 of the observability plan is complete.** Every hook decision
point in vsdd-factory that carries a meaningful structured signal now
emits a `hook.block` or `hook.action` event. Registry: 70 reason codes
across 30 instrumented hooks.

### New: `hook.action` event type

Introduced for passive state-change signals that aren't anomalies.
`update-wave-state-on-merge` emits `type=hook.action` when a story merge
is recorded — the event is telemetry, not a caught issue. Dashboards
that count "blocks" filter `type=hook.block`; dashboards that visualize
pipeline activity include both types.

### Changed

- **`handoff-validator.sh`** (SubagentStop) — two reasons,
  `severity=warn`: `subagent_empty_result` (zero non-ws chars) and
  `subagent_truncated_result` (<40 non-ws chars; event carries `result_len`).
- **`pr-manager-completion-guard.sh`** (SubagentStop) — reason
  `pr_manager_incomplete_lifecycle`. Event carries `step_count`, `last_step`,
  `next_step` — aggregate to find where pr-manager most often exits early.
- **`update-wave-state-on-merge.sh`** (SubagentStop) — `type=hook.action`
  with reason `wave_merge_recorded`. Event carries `story_id`, `wave`,
  `total` (stories in wave), `merged` (merged so far), `gate_transitioned`
  (bool: whether this merge flipped `gate_status` to `pending`). Python
  body now writes structured key=value lines to stdout which the shell
  forwards to `emit-event`, keeping emission in bash.
- **`validate-pr-review-posted.sh`** (SubagentStop) — reason
  `pr_review_not_posted`.
- **`warn-pending-wave-gate.sh`** (Stop) — reason
  `pending_wave_gate_at_session_end`, `severity=warn`. Event carries
  `pending_waves` (comma-separated).

### Not instrumented (intentional)

- **`session-learning.sh`** (Stop) — passive append-only hook. Writes a
  timestamp marker to `sidecar-learning.md` every session end with no
  anomaly detection logic. Nothing structured to emit. Documented in
  observability registry.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/stop-hooks-emission.bats`** (new) — 12 tests covering all
  five instrumented stop-family hooks, the `hook.action` event type,
  severity=warn cases, and the standard `VSDD_TELEMETRY=off` regression.
- 920 tests across 28 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — registry grown from 64 to 70 reason
  codes; added new "SubagentStop and Stop hooks" section; documented
  `hook.action` event type alongside `hook.block`; Phase 2 roadmap fully
  marked shipped across all sub-phases (2a → 2e).
- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — added rows for four previously
  uncounted SubagentStop hooks; Instrumented column ticked for all five.

### Phase 2 summary

| Sub-phase | Hooks | New codes | Release |
|-----------|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 (foundation) | — | — | 0.56.0 |
| 2a (PreToolUse Bash) | 4 | 35 | 0.57.0 |
| 2b (PreToolUse Edit\|Write) | 5 | 6 | 0.58.0 |
| 2c (PreToolUse Agent) | 2 | 2 | 0.59.0 |
| 2d.1 (Policy validators) | 4 | 4 | 0.60.0 |
| 2d.2 (Structural validators) | 7 | 7 | 0.61.0 |
| 2d.3 (Workflow validators) | 10 | 10 | 0.62.0 |
| 2e (SubagentStop + Stop) | 5 | 6 | 0.63.0 |
| **Total** | **37 emission sites across 30 hooks** | **70 codes** | — |

Two hooks remain intentionally uninstrumented: `check-factory-commit.sh`
(advisory-only hint, no anomaly detection) and
`validate-index-self-reference.sh` + `session-learning.sh` (pure stderr
advisories / passive appends with no structured signal).

### What's next

- **Phase 3** — `bin/factory-query` CLI with canned queries against the
  event log; `bin/factory-report` daily/weekly/per-cycle summaries.
- **Phase 4** — `/factory-health` slash command (text dashboard from
  STATE.md + wave-state.yaml + recent events).
- **Phase 5** — Opt-in Docker observability stack (OTel Collector +
  Grafana LGTM single-container) with preconfigured dashboards.
- **Phase 6** — Session replay, agent SLO tracking, pipeline flame graphs.

## 0.62.0 — Observability Phase 2d.3: instrument workflow validators (PostToolUse complete)

Final sub-release of Phase 2d. Instruments the remaining 10 PostToolUse
validators. **21 of 22 PostToolUse hooks now emit structured events.**
Registry has grown to 64 reason codes.

### Changed

- **`purity-check.sh`** — reason `pure_core_boundary_violation`,
  `severity=warn`. Event carries `patterns` field (space-joined list of
  matched side-effect idioms) for aggregating "which stdlib boundaries
  get crossed most often."
- **`validate-input-hash.sh`** — reason `input_hash_invalid_format`
  (format-block path only; advisory drift warnings remain stderr-only).
  Event carries `stored_hash`, `hash_len`, and `issue` (`length`|`chars`).
- **`validate-novelty-assessment.sh`** — reason `novelty_assessment_incomplete`.
- **`convergence-tracker.sh`** — reason `convergence_rule_violation`
  (premature CONVERGENCE_REACHED path). Event carries `verdict` and
  `novelty_score` for trend aggregation.
- **`validate-anchor-capabilities-union.sh`** — reason
  `anchor_capabilities_mismatch`. Event carries `expected` and `actual`
  so mis-derivations are visible in one jq row.
- **`validate-demo-evidence-story-scoped.sh`** — reason
  `demo_evidence_not_story_scoped`.
- **`validate-pr-description-completeness.sh`** — reason `pr_description_incomplete`.
- **`validate-wave-gate-completeness.sh`** — reason `wave_gate_incomplete`.
- **`validate-factory-path-root.sh`** — reason `factory_path_worktree_relative`.
  Event carries `worktree` for "which stories most commonly trip this."
- **`regression-gate.sh`** — reason `regression_gate_pass_to_fail`,
  `severity=warn`. First emission on a Bash-matcher PostToolUse hook;
  previous PostToolUse emissions were all Edit|Write. Hook never blocks
  (it's pure telemetry) — the event is the whole point.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/workflow-validators-emission.bats`** (new) — 13 tests covering
  per-hook emission, severity=warn variants, `pass→pass` no-op case,
  and the standard `VSDD_TELEMETRY=off` regression. 908 tests across 27
  suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — registry grown from 54 to 64
  reason codes; Phase 2d fully marked shipped across 2d.1/2d.2/2d.3.
- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — Instrumented column filled for
  all 10 hooks; added rows for `validate-anchor-capabilities-union.sh`,
  `validate-demo-evidence-story-scoped.sh`,
  `validate-pr-description-completeness.sh`,
  `validate-wave-gate-completeness.sh`, and
  `validate-factory-path-root.sh` (all previously missing from the
  summary table).

### Phase 2d status

PostToolUse instrumentation is complete. The factory's hot path — every
time an agent writes a spec, story, review, PR artifact, or STATE.md —
now produces a structured audit event when a validator fires.

### Not yet instrumented

- Phase 2e: 6 SubagentStop + Stop hooks (final pass before the tooling
  / dashboard work begins).

## 0.61.0 — Observability Phase 2d.2: instrument structural validators

Instruments 7 of 8 structural PostToolUse validators. Introduces a
`severity` field on emitted events for advisory-level hooks that exit 1
rather than 2 (so dashboards can distinguish hard blocks from warnings).

### Changed

- **`validate-template-compliance.sh`** — reason `template_noncompliant`.
  Event carries `template` (template basename) and `missing_keys` for
  aggregating "which fields do agents forget most often."
- **`validate-finding-format.sh`** — reason `finding_id_legacy_format`.
- **`validate-table-cell-count.sh`** — reason `table_cell_count_mismatch`.
- **`validate-changelog-monotonicity.sh`** — reason `changelog_not_monotonic`.
- **`validate-state-size.sh`** — reason `state_bloat`. Event carries
  `line_count` and `limit` to track how far over the bound the file grew.
- **`validate-state-pin-freshness.sh`** — reason `state_version_pin_drift`.
- **`validate-state-index-status-coherence.sh`** — reason
  `state_index_status_drift`, **`severity=warn`** (hook exits 1, not 2).
  First use of the severity field — lets dashboards filter warn-vs-block.

### Not instrumented (intentional)

- **`validate-index-self-reference.sh`** — pure advisory: always exits 0,
  emits stderr only, doesn't flag a structured anomaly. Nothing
  machine-actionable to emit. Documented in the registry.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/structural-validators-emission.bats`** (new) — 13 tests.
  895 tests across 26 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — registry grown from 47 to 54 codes;
  roadmap marks 2d.2 shipped.
- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — Instrumented column ticked for
  all 7 structural validators (6 exit-2 + 1 exit-1 warn); added row for
  `validate-state-index-status-coherence.sh` (was previously missing).

### Not yet instrumented

- Phase 2d.3: 10 workflow/specialized validators (purity-check, input-hash,
  novelty-assessment, convergence-tracker, anchor-capabilities-union,
  demo-evidence-story-scoped, pr-description-completeness,
  wave-gate-completeness, factory-path-root, regression-gate).
- Phase 2e: 6 SubagentStop + Stop hooks.

## 0.60.0 — Observability Phase 2d.1: instrument policy validators

Starts the PostToolUse validator instrumentation pass. Phase 2d is
sub-split into three releases (policy, structural, workflow) to keep
each diff bisectable.

### Changed

- **`validate-subsystem-names.sh`** (Policy 6) — reason
  `policy6_subsystem_name_mismatch`.
- **`validate-bc-title.sh`** (Policy 7) — reason `policy7_bc_title_mismatch`.
  Event carries `bc_id`, `h1_title`, `index_title` — an immediate diff
  of which title drifted from which authoritative source.
- **`validate-story-bc-sync.sh`** (Policy 8) — reason
  `policy8_bc_array_desync`.
- **`validate-vp-consistency.sh`** (Policy 9) — reason
  `policy9_vp_inconsistency`.

Each event carries `matcher=PostToolUse` and `file_path=<path to the
edited file>`.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/policy-validators-emission.bats`** (new) — 12 tests covering
  per-hook emission paths, the standard failure-tolerance regressions,
  and three "clean scenario emits no event" no-op cases. 882 tests
  across 25 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — registry grown from 43 to 47 reason
  codes; roadmap split Phase 2d into 2d.1/2d.2/2d.3 sub-phases.
- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — Instrumented column ticked for
  all 4 policy validators.

### Not yet instrumented

- Phase 2d.2: 8 structural validators (template-compliance, finding-format,
  table-cell-count, changelog-monotonicity, state-size, state-pin-freshness,
  state-index-status-coherence, index-self-reference).
- Phase 2d.3: 10 workflow/specialized validators (purity-check, input-hash,
  novelty-assessment, convergence-tracker, anchor-capabilities-union,
  demo-evidence-story-scoped, pr-description-completeness,
  wave-gate-completeness, factory-path-root, regression-gate).
- Phase 2e: 6 SubagentStop + Stop hooks.

## 0.59.0 — Observability Phase 2c: instrument PreToolUse Agent guards

Instruments the two hooks that govern subagent dispatch. Adds 2 reason
codes. Both hooks now emit rich structured context that makes Wave gate
and PR merge failures diagnosable without scrolling logs.

### Changed

- **`validate-wave-gate-prerequisite.sh`** — reason
  `wave_gate_prerequisite_not_passed`. Event carries `subagent`,
  `story_id`, `target_wave`, `blocking_wave`, `blocking_status`. Makes
  it trivial to aggregate which wave gates are blocking which
  downstream stories.
- **`validate-pr-merge-prerequisites.sh`** — reason
  `pr_merge_evidence_missing`. Event carries `story_id`, `delivery_dir`,
  and a comma-separated `missing` field listing which evidence files
  are absent (`pr-description.md`, `pr-review.md`, `security-review.md`).
  The unrelated advisory warning (directory entirely absent) still
  fires unchanged and does not emit an event.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/agent-guards-emission.bats`** (new) — 11 tests covering
  per-hook emission paths and the standard failure-tolerance regressions
  (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` unset, path broken, `VSDD_TELEMETRY=off`).
  Also tests the "passed gate" and "complete delivery" no-op cases.
- 870 tests across 24 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — registry grown from 41 to 43
  reason codes; Phase 2c marked shipped in the roadmap.
- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — added rows for both Agent-matcher
  hooks (previously uncounted); Instrumented column ticked.

### Not yet instrumented

- Phase 2d: 21 PostToolUse validators (bulk)
- Phase 2e: 6 SubagentStop + Stop hooks

## 0.58.0 — Observability Phase 2b: instrument PreToolUse Edit|Write guards

Continues the instrumentation pass. Five more hooks now emit structured
`hook.block` events. Adds 6 reason codes to the registry. Docs updated
inline per the Tier-2 cadence.

### Changed

- **`brownfield-discipline.sh`** — reason `reference_readonly`.
- **`protect-vp.sh`** — reason `vp_green_immutable`. Emission happens
  inside `emit_deny()`; the existing JSON-envelope `permissionDecision`
  response format is preserved (this hook emits the envelope instead of
  exiting 2).
- **`protect-bc.sh`** — reason `bc_green_immutable`. Same pattern.
- **`red-gate.sh`** — reason `red_gate_strict_violation`.
- **`factory-branch-guard.sh`** — reasons `factory_not_worktree` and
  `factory_wrong_branch`. The second event includes `current_branch` and
  `expected_branch` as extra fields to aid triage.

Each event carries `type=hook.block`, `hook=<name>`, `matcher=<Edit|Write>`
(taken from `.tool_name` in the input so emissions distinguish Edit vs.
Write), `reason=<code>`, `file_path=<path>`.

### Added (tests)

- **`tests/edit-guards-emission.bats`** (new) — 17 tests covering per-hook
  emission paths and the "still blocks when emit-event is broken"
  regressions (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` unset, path broken, `VSDD_TELEMETRY=off`).
- 859 tests across 23 suites, 0 failures.

### Docs

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** — reason-code registry grown from 35
  to 41 codes; Phase 2b marked shipped in the roadmap.
- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — Instrumented column for all 5
  Edit|Write guards ticked (9 of 22 hooks in the summary table now ticked;
  remaining 13 pending Phases 2c–2e).

### Not yet instrumented

- Phase 2c: `validate-wave-gate-prerequisite.sh`, `validate-pr-merge-prerequisites.sh`
- Phase 2d: 21 PostToolUse validators
- Phase 2e: `handoff-validator.sh`, `pr-manager-completion-guard.sh`,

## 0.57.1 — Observability docs (docs-only patch)

Documentation catch-up for the observability work shipped in 0.56.0 and
0.57.0. No code or behavior changes.

### Added

- **`docs/guide/observability.md`** (new) — single-page user + developer
  reference. Covers: env-var controls, log location and rotation, event
  schema, `jq` query recipes, the full reason-code registry (35 codes as
  of 0.57.0), "how to instrument your own hook" recipe, safety
  guarantees, and the Phase 2-6 roadmap.

### Changed

- **`docs/guide/hooks-reference.md`** — added `protect-secrets.sh` row
  (missing since 0.55.0), added `block-ai-attribution.sh` row, added new
  "Instrumented" column showing which hooks emit to the event log (4
  ticked, 18 pending), added pointer to observability guide. A broader
  audit to reconcile the hook count with the current plugin is deferred
  to an end-of-Phase-2 cleanup release.
- **`docs/guide/configuration.md`** — expanded `destructive-command-guard`
  description with all v0.55.0 additions, added `protect-secrets` rows
  under both Bash and Read matcher sections, added `block-ai-attribution`,
  added new "Environment variables" section documenting `VSDD_TELEMETRY`,
  `VSDD_LOG_DIR`, and `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`.
- **`README.md`** — added `Observability` row to the user guide table;
  retitled Hooks Reference description to mention instrumentation.

## 0.57.0 — Observability Phase 2a: instrument PreToolUse Bash guards

First use of the `emit-event` helper shipped in 0.56.0. Four PreToolUse
Bash guards now emit a structured `hook.block` event at every decision
point, tagged with a stable `reason` code for aggregation and dashboards.

### Changed

- **`destructive-command-guard.sh`** — all 27 `block()` call sites now
  carry a reason code; `block()` emits a `hook.block` event before exiting.
  Reason codes: `catastrophic_root`, `protected_path_delete`, `sot_delete`,
  `sot_clobber_redirect`, `sot_truncate_colon`, `sot_truncate_cmd`,
  `sot_clobber_cpnull`, `find_delete_protected`, `git_reset_hard`,
  `git_clean_force`, `git_checkout_dot`, `git_restore_dot`,
  `git_stash_discard`, `git_branch_d_protected`, `git_filter_history`,
  `git_reflog_expire`, `git_gc_prune_now`, `git_worktree_force`,
  `git_no_verify`, `git_no_gpg_sign`, `git_rm_protected`,
  `gh_repo_delete`, `gh_release_delete`, `gh_pr_close`, `gh_issue_delete`,
  `rce_pipe_to_shell`, `recursive_permission_change`.
- **`protect-secrets.sh`** — 6 reason codes: `env_file_read_direct`
  (Read tool), `env_file_read_shell` (cat/less/grep/etc. on .env),
  `env_file_copy` (cp/mv of real .env source), `env_file_archive`
  (tar/zip of .env), `secret_var_echo`, `secret_var_grep`.
- **`verify-git-push.sh`** — refactored inline `echo; exit 2` sites into a
  shared `block()` function; 2 reason codes: `git_push_force`,
  `git_push_protected`.
- **`block-ai-attribution.sh`** — same refactor; 2 codes:
  `ai_attribution_coauthored`, `ai_attribution_generated`.

Every event carries `type=hook.block`, `hook=<name>`, `matcher=<Bash|Read>`,
`reason=<code>`, `command=<original>`, plus the auto-injected `ts` and
`schema_version` from `bin/emit-event`.

### Safety guarantees (preserved from 0.56.0)

- Each hook still blocks identically when `emit-event` is missing, broken,
  or disabled. The emission is always `2>/dev/null || true`.
- `VSDD_TELEMETRY=off` short-circuits emission at line 1 of `emit-event`.
- Missing `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` → silent no-op, hook still blocks.

### Added (tests)

- 8 new emission tests in `tests/destructive-guard.bats` (105 total),
  including three "hook still blocks when emit-event is broken" regressions.
- 7 new emission tests in `tests/protect-secrets.bats` (62 total).
- 842 tests across 22 suites, 0 failures.

### Not yet instrumented (coming in later sub-phases)

- `check-factory-commit.sh` — advisory-only, emits `additionalContext`
  hints but never blocks. Will get a `hook.advice` event type in a later pass.
- Phase 2b: PreToolUse Edit|Write guards (5 hooks).
- Phase 2c: PreToolUse Agent guards (2 hooks).
- Phase 2d: PostToolUse validators (21 hooks).
- Phase 2e: SubagentStop + Stop hooks (6 hooks).

## 0.56.0 — Observability Phase 1: emit-event safety scaffold

First increment of the local-first observability plan. Ships the foundation
without instrumenting any hooks yet — the guarantee being proven in this
release is that **calling the emitter cannot break vsdd-factory** under any
failure mode.

### Added

- **`bin/emit-event`** — failure-tolerant structured event emitter. Writes
  one JSON event per invocation to `.factory/logs/events-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`.
  Hard guarantees:
  - Exits 0 on every path (missing `jq`, missing disk, read-only log dir,
    malformed args, disk full — all silent drops).
  - No stdout/stderr on success.
  - POSIX-portable date format (macOS, Linux, WSL, git-bash).
  - Atomic append (relies on POSIX PIPE_BUF guarantee, no `flock`).
  - `VSDD_TELEMETRY=off` kill switch (line-1 short-circuit).
  - `VSDD_LOG_DIR=<path>` override (default `.factory/logs`).
  - Args are `key=value` pairs; values may contain any characters (spaces,
    quotes, newlines, `=`); jq handles escaping.
  - Auto-adds `ts` (ISO-8601 w/ tz) and `schema_version` (integer) fields.

### Added (tests)

- `tests/emit-event.bats` — 35 tests covering structural checks, exit-code
  guarantees (garbage args, binary data, 10KB values, 50 field pairs), kill
  switch, graceful degradation (missing jq, readonly log dir, unwritable
  parent, auto-creation of deep dirs), emission correctness (valid JSON,
  ISO-8601 timestamp, schema version, field preservation, quote/backslash
  escaping, `=` in values, dotted keys stay flat), and append semantics.
- 827 tests across 22 suites, 0 failures.

### Notes

- Nothing currently calls `emit-event`. Phase 2 will instrument the 21
  existing hooks to emit events at decision points.
- Logs land under `.factory/logs/` which is already gitignored on `main`.
- Target shells: bash on macOS, Linux, WSL, and git-bash. Native PowerShell
  on Windows is out of scope for Phase 1.

## 0.55.0 — Harden destructive-command-guard + add protect-secrets hook

### Added

- **`destructive-command-guard.sh` — Tier 1 guards** (new):
  - Catastrophic root targets: `rm -rf /`, `/*`, `~`, `~/`, `$HOME`, `*`, `.*` (and flag-order variants)
  - Clobbering redirects to source-of-truth files: `> STATE.md`, `: > STATE.md`, `truncate -s 0`, `cp /dev/null`. `>>` (append) and `sed -i` remain allowed.
  - `find … -delete` and `find … -exec rm` on `.factory`, `src/`, `tests/`
  - `git stash drop` / `git stash clear`
  - `git branch -D main|master|develop`
  - `git filter-branch` / `git filter-repo`
- **`destructive-command-guard.sh` — Tier 2 guards** (new):
  - `--no-verify` on `git commit|merge|rebase|cherry-pick|am`, plus `--no-gpg-sign` on commit
  - `gh repo delete`, `gh release delete`, `gh pr close`, `gh issue delete`
  - `git reflog expire --expire=now` and `git gc --prune=now`
  - `git worktree remove --force` outside `.worktrees/`
  - Pipe-to-interpreter RCE pattern: `curl|wget|fetch ... | bash|sh|zsh|python|perl|ruby`
- **`destructive-command-guard.sh` — Tier 3 guards** (new):
  - Recursive `chmod -R` / `chown -R` / `--recursive` on `.factory`, `src/`, `tests/`, `.git/`
- **`protect-secrets.sh`** (new PreToolUse hook, matches Bash and Read):
  - Blocks `Read` of `.env`, `.env.*`, `.envrc` (allows `.env.example` / `.sample` / `.template`)
  - Blocks `cat|less|more|head|tail|bat|xxd|od|strings|grep|awk|sed` on real .env files
  - Blocks `cp|mv|rsync|scp` when the **source** is a real .env (allows template-bootstrap like `cp .env.example .env`)
  - Blocks `tar|zip` that archive real .env files
  - Blocks `echo|printf` of secret-shaped env vars (`$*_TOKEN`, `$*_SECRET`, `$*_PASSWORD`, `$*_API_KEY`, `$*_PRIVATE_KEY`, `$*_ACCESS_KEY`, `$*_CREDENTIAL`, `$*_AUTH`)
  - Blocks `env|printenv|set | grep` for secret-shaped names
  - Allows existence checks (`ls .env*`, `test -f .env`, `[ -f .env ]`) and sourcing (`source .env`, `. .env`)

### Fixed

- **`destructive-command-guard.sh` — bare `.factory` match** — `rm -rf .factory` (no trailing slash) previously slipped through the substring check; now caught via regex that handles end-of-command, slash, or separator boundary.
- **`destructive-command-guard.sh` — long-form recursive flag** — `rm --recursive` is now recognized alongside `-r`, `-R`, `-rf`, `-fr`, `-Rf`, `-fR`.

### Added (tests)

- 41 new tests in `tests/destructive-guard.bats` (catastrophic roots, SoT redirection, find-delete, git-stash-drop, git-branch-D, history rewriters, --no-verify, gh destructive, curl|bash, recursive chmod/chown) — 97 tests total in suite
- `tests/protect-secrets.bats` (new) — 55 tests covering Read + Bash paths, cp source-vs-destination semantics, secret env echo/grep
- `run-all.sh` wires the new protect-secrets suite
- 792 tests across 21 suites, 0 failures

## 0.54.0 — Unify red-gate-log path + factory path root guard

### Fixed

- **Red-gate-log path unified** — three conflicting paths (`.factory/stories/`, `.factory/phase-f4-implementation/`, `.factory/cycles/**/implementation/`) consolidated to `.factory/cycles/<cycle-id>/<story-id>/implementation/red-gate-log.md` across deliver-story skill, step files, phase-3 guide, per-story-delivery orchestrator, and phase-f4 skill.

### Added

- **`validate-factory-path-root.sh`** (PostToolUse on Write/Edit) — blocks `.factory/` writes that resolve inside `.worktrees/STORY-NNN/.factory/` instead of the project root. Catches agents using relative paths from inside story worktrees. Diagnostic shows the expected absolute path.
- 8 new BATS tests for factory path root validation
- 691 tests across 21 suites, 0 failures

## 0.53.0 — Wave gate completeness enforcement + GATE_CHECK telemetry

### Added

- **`validate-wave-gate-completeness.sh`** (PostToolUse on Write to wave-state.yaml) — blocks marking gate_status: passed unless the gate report contains evidence of all 6 gates (test suite, DTU validation, adversarial review, demo evidence, holdout evaluation, state update). Accepts both human-readable "Gate N" headings and structured GATE_CHECK telemetry lines.
- **GATE_CHECK telemetry** added to wave-gate skill — structured `GATE_CHECK: gate=N name=<name> status=<pass|fail|skip> note=<reason>` lines emitted after each gate, enabling mechanical validation by the completeness hook.
- 10 new BATS tests for gate completeness validation
- 682 tests across 21 suites, 0 failures

## 0.52.0 — Wave gate enforcement + PR lifecycle hooks + AI attribution blocker

### Added

- **Wave gate enforcement** (3 hooks):
  - `validate-wave-gate-prerequisite.sh` (PreToolUse on Agent) — blocks Wave N+1 worker dispatch if Wave N gate not passed/deferred
  - `update-wave-state-on-merge.sh` (SubagentStop on pr-manager) — auto-updates wave-state.yaml when stories merge, flips gate_status to pending when all wave stories merged
  - `warn-pending-wave-gate.sh` (Stop) — session-end reminder for pending gates
  - `wave-state-template.yaml` — structured wave lifecycle tracker template

- **PR lifecycle enforcement** (3 hooks):
  - `validate-pr-description-completeness.sh` (PostToolUse on Write) — blocks incomplete PR descriptions missing required sections or containing unresolved template placeholders
  - `validate-pr-review-posted.sh` (SubagentStop on pr-reviewer) — blocks if pr-reviewer didn't write pr-review.md or used `gh pr comment` instead of `gh pr review`
  - `validate-pr-merge-prerequisites.sh` (PreToolUse on Agent) — blocks merge dispatch if evidence trail (pr-description.md, pr-review.md, security-review.md) is missing

- **`block-ai-attribution.sh`** (PreToolUse on Bash) — blocks git commits containing Co-Authored-By: Claude/GPT/Gemini, "Generated with Claude Code", or noreply@anthropic.com patterns

- 80 new BATS tests across 2 test files (37 wave-gate + 43 PR lifecycle)
- 672 tests across 21 suites, 0 failures

## 0.51.0 — PR manager completion guard hook (FM4 detection)

### Added

- **`pr-manager-completion-guard.sh`** — SubagentStop hook that detects FM4 (pr-manager exiting before completing all 9 lifecycle steps). Blocks the stop via exit 2 and injects a continuation prompt with the next step hint. Accepts 8+ STEP_COMPLETE emissions as complete (allows one N/A skip). Passes through legitimate BLOCKED exits.
- 22 new BATS tests covering: scope filtering, full completion, partial exits at steps 0/1/3/5/7/8, BLOCKED passthrough, agent name matching variants, edge cases
- 592 tests across 19 suites, 0 failures

## 0.50.0 — Replace sessions_spawn with Agent tool + pr-manager hardening

### Fixed

- **pr-manager agent** — replaced all 13 `sessions_spawn` calls with `Agent(subagent_type=...)` syntax. Added COORDINATOR RULE meta-instruction, explicit continuation clauses after every sub-agent spawn (prevents premature exit on reviewer APPROVE), merge pre-authorization (`AUTHORIZE_MERGE=yes`), and STEP_COMPLETE instrumentation for all 9 steps.
- **sessions_spawn removed project-wide** — all references across 22 files (orchestrator, FACTORY.md, pr-reviewer, security-reviewer, code-delivery, 12 skill boilerplate lines, templates) replaced with Agent tool syntax. Zero `sessions_spawn` references remain.

### Changed

- FACTORY.md Sub-Agent Delegation Rule rewritten for Agent tool pattern
- Orchestrator delegation section updated with Agent tool examples
- agent-file-review audit rule updated to reflect pr-manager as legitimate Agent tool user

## 0.49.0 — Per-story demo evidence scoping (POL-010)

### Added

- **POL-010: `demo_evidence_story_scoped`** — all demo-recorder output must live under `docs/demo-evidence/<STORY-ID>/`, preventing evidence-report.md collisions across stories
- **`validate-demo-evidence-story-scoped.sh`** — PostToolUse lint hook that blocks flat-level file creation at `docs/demo-evidence/*.md`
- Policy entry added to `policies-template.yaml` (id: 10)

### Changed

- **demo-recorder agent** — output root changed from `docs/demo-evidence/` to `docs/demo-evidence/<STORY-ID>/`, constraint added forbidding flat-level files
- **per-story-delivery orchestrator** — task prompt updated with `<STORY-ID>` subfolder and collision-prevention explanation
- **deliver-story skill + steps** — all path references updated to per-story scoped
- **code-delivery skill** — paths, gates, and tree diagram updated
- **pr-manager, pr-reviewer agents** — evidence gate paths updated
- **record-demo skill** — output paths updated to per-story scoped
- **demo-recording skill** — internal factory paths unchanged (`.factory/demo-evidence/`)
- **Templates** — demo-tape-template.tape, demo-playwright-template.spec.ts output paths updated with `{STORY_ID}` placeholder
- **Workflows** — greenfield.lobster, code-delivery.lobster commit paths updated
- **Docs** — phase-3-tdd-delivery.md, FACTORY.md, configuration.md, factory-protocol.md updated
- Removed Tally MCP dependency — all 27 references across 18 files removed. Traceability chain simplified: `BC → VP → test → src → ADV → KANI` (TALLY-xxx link was redundant)

## 0.48.0 — Semantic drift lint hooks

### Added

- **`validate-state-index-status-coherence.sh`** — PostToolUse hook detecting drift between STATE.md `convergence_status:` frontmatter and cycle INDEX.md `**Status:**` lines. Normalizes underscores/hyphens and case for comparison, trims trailing descriptions after em-dash. Warning only (exit 1) — state transitions often land at different commits within the same burst.
- **`validate-anchor-capabilities-union.sh`** — PostToolUse hook enforcing the invariant that a story's `anchor_capabilities:` must equal the sorted union of `capability:` fields across all referenced BCs. Handles dual-anchor BCs with CSV capabilities, warns (but doesn't block) on missing BC files. Block on mismatch (exit 2) with BC→CAP mapping diagnostic.
- 22 new BATS tests covering both hooks (pass, fail, edge cases, wiring)

## 0.47.0 — Glob/directory expansion for input-hash + docs update

### Added

- **Glob/directory expansion** in `compute-input-hash` — artifacts can now use `inputs: [behavioral-contracts/**]` (recursive glob) or `inputs: [domain-spec/]` (directory) instead of listing every file. Expansion uses `find` + `LC_ALL=C sort` for deterministic ordering.
- 4 new glob tests (directory expansion, ** wildcard, deterministic hash, missing glob directory)

### Changed

- README updated: 116 skills, 108 commands, 26 hooks, 99 templates, 538 tests across 17 suites. All per-suite test counts updated. Contributing section: 9 Iron Laws, 80 Red Flags.
- hooks-reference.md: updated from 19 to 26 hooks with 8 new entries
- id-reference.md: ADV producer "Phase 1d/2/3/5", FIX producer "Phase 5/6/7", enforcement table expanded with 8 new hooks
- 538 tests across 17 suites

## 0.46.1 — Strip .factory/ prefix from input paths

### Fixed

- **compute-input-hash** — inputs with `.factory/` prefix (e.g., `inputs: [.factory/specs/prd.md]`) resolved to double-nested paths that don't exist. Now strips the prefix when FACTORY_ROOT is known, falls back to original if stripping fails. 534 tests.

## 0.46.0 — Input resolution mode + partial hash safety

### Added

- **`compute-input-hash --resolve`** — per-file and batch mode to check if all inputs are resolvable, naming specific missing files
- **`--scan <dir> --resolve`** — batch find all artifacts with unresolvable inputs (TOTAL/RESOLVABLE/UNRESOLVABLE)

### Fixed

- **Refuse partial hashing** — binary no longer silently hashes incomplete input sets. Missing inputs produce PARTIAL warning; hash/update/print all refuse to proceed. Prevents false MATCH from two partial hashes agreeing.
- **Named missing files** — all warnings now list the specific missing input file names (was just a count)
- **Warn in all modes** — missing input warnings fire in check, update, and print modes (was print-only)

### Changed

- `check-input-drift` skill: Step 2 (Resolve inputs) is now MANDATORY before interpreting drift results. Documents common causes (not yet produced, renamed, wrong path, deleted) with fix actions. Steps renumbered 1-6.
- 532 tests across 17 suites

## 0.45.1 — Fix absolute vs relative path bug in compute-input-hash

### Fixed

- **compute-input-hash** — absolute paths to `--scan` produced 62 false-positive STALE results vs 2 correct with relative paths. Root cause: `FACTORY_ROOT` pattern match behaved differently with relative vs absolute file paths. Fix: canonicalize `FILE` to absolute via `cd+pwd` before resolution logic runs. Both paths now produce identical results.
- 2 regression tests added (path identity + different-cwd scan)
- 527 tests across 17 suites

## 0.45.0 — Cluster drift triage for input-hash scanning

### Added

- **Step 5: Triage cluster drift** in `check-input-drift` skill — recognizes patterns where multiple related artifacts drift simultaneously (all domain-spec shards, all BCs for a subsystem, PRD + supplements) and routes to producing agents for content review before hash bumping
- Dispatch table mapping 7 artifact types to producing agents (business-analyst, product-owner, architect, story-writer)
- Task template for dispatched agents with content review instructions
- Common Cluster Drift Patterns reference table (7 patterns)
- Warning gate: Step 4 `--update` on >3 files requires Step 5 triage first
- 6 new BATS tests — 526 tests across 17 suites

## 0.44.0 — Batch input-hash drift scanning

### Added

- **`compute-input-hash --scan <dir>`** — batch drift detection that walks all `.factory/**/*.md` artifacts in one command. Avoids Claude Code's multi-line shell auto-backgrounding issue that killed inline bash loops before output flushed.
- **`compute-input-hash --scan <dir> --update`** — batch remediation of all stale hashes
- Summary line output: `TOTAL=N MATCH=N STALE=N UNCOMPUTED=N NOINPUT=N UPDATED=N UPDATE_FAILED=N`
- 14 new BATS tests (input-hash-scan.bats) — 520 tests across 17 suites

### Changed

- `check-input-drift` skill updated: uses `--scan` instead of manual iteration, documents both batch and per-file modes
- All existing per-file invocations (`<file>`, `<file> --update`, `<file> --check`) unchanged

## 0.43.1 — Shellcheck gate + post-release fixes

### Added

- **Shellcheck gate test** in hook-robustness.bats — runs shellcheck on all hooks and bin scripts, catches SC2001/SC2012 before release (506 tests)

### Fixed

- `validate-index-self-reference.sh` — sed → parameter expansion (shellcheck SC2001)
- `validate-table-cell-count.sh` — sed → parameter expansion (shellcheck SC2001)

## 0.43.0 — Corpus lint hooks + comprehensive glossary

### Added

- **4 new corpus lint hooks** targeting recurring adversarial finding defect classes:
  - `validate-table-cell-count.sh` — blocks markdown table rows with mismatched pipe count (caught 134 BCs in one Prism pass)
  - `validate-changelog-monotonicity.sh` — blocks duplicate versions, ascending order, date inversions, frontmatter mismatch
  - `validate-state-pin-freshness.sh` — blocks STATE.md version pins that don't match actual artifact versions
  - `validate-index-self-reference.sh` — warns when INDEX/burst-log edited without current burst row
- Extended `validate-input-hash.sh` — now blocks non-7-char hashes and non-lowercase-hex characters (caught 23 files in one pass)
- 45 new BATS tests across corpus-lint.bats (35) and edge cases (10) — 505 total across 16 suites
- **Glossary expanded to 110 entries** — added all spec levels (L1-L4), all 8 phases (0-7), architecture concepts (Purity Boundary, Pure Core, Effectful Shell), convergence metrics (Confidence Score, Hallucination Fingerprinting, MVR, Satisfaction Score), operational concepts (Burst, Per-Story Delivery Flow, Model Tier), and verification tools (Kani, Semgrep)

### Fixed

- `validate-input-hash.sh` null handling — `null` is not a valid placeholder (warns), only `[live-state]` and `[pending-recompute]` silently skip
- 26 hooks total, 505 tests across 16 suites

## 0.42.0 — Iron Laws and Red Flags for all critical pipeline skills

### Added

- **5 new Iron Laws** with Red Flags tables for critical skills:
  - `decompose-stories`: NO STORY WITHOUT BC TRACEABILITY FIRST (8 flags)
  - `holdout-eval`: NO HOLDOUT EVALUATION WITHOUT INFORMATION ASYMMETRY FIRST (8 flags)
  - `convergence-check`: NO RELEASE WITHOUT ALL SEVEN DIMENSIONS CONVERGED (8 flags)
  - `formal-verify`: NO HARDENING SIGN-OFF WITHOUT ALL PROOF HARNESSES PASSING (8 flags)
  - `create-architecture`: NO ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT VERIFICATION FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT (8 flags)
- Total: 9 Iron Laws, 80 Red Flag entries across the pipeline

### Fixed

- **Minimum pass count inconsistency** — adversarial-review SKILL.md and adversary.md both said "Minimum 2 passes", now correctly say "Minimum 3 clean passes" matching CONVERGENCE.md and all convergence hooks
- **Maximum pass escalation** — "Maximum 5" → "Maximum 10" matching convergence loop `max_iterations` in all lobster files

## 0.41.3 — Restore adversary agent model tier

### Fixed

- **adversary.md** — `model: adversary` (invalid tier) restored to `model: opus`

## 0.41.2 — Cycle file templates for state management

### Added

- **5 new templates** for cycle-scoped state files: `burst-log-template.md`, `convergence-trajectory-template.md`, `session-checkpoints-template.md`, `lessons-template.md`, `blocking-issues-resolved-template.md`
- Template references added to `compact-state` skill and `state-manager` agent (99 templates total)

## 0.41.1 — Post-release bugfixes

### Fixed

- **Command files** — `check-state-health.md` and `compact-state.md` had empty body text after frontmatter, causing `cache_control cannot be set for empty text blocks` API error when invoked
- **convergence-tracker.sh** — replaced `ls` with `find` to satisfy shellcheck SC2012

## 0.41.0 — Adversarial review hardening + state management + convergence enforcement

### Added

- **Per-story adversarial review** — full convergence loop in `code-delivery.lobster` after implementation, before demo recording. Scoped to story diff with information asymmetry walls
- **Phase 2 adversarial convergence loop** — added to `phase-2-story-decomposition.lobster` (was missing entirely)
- **Wave-level adversarial convergence** — upgraded from single-pass to full convergence loop in both `greenfield.lobster` and `feature.lobster`
- **`validate-novelty-assessment.sh` hook** (21st) — blocks adversarial review files missing the structured Novelty Assessment section (pass, novelty score, trajectory, verdict)
- **`convergence-tracker.sh` hook** (22nd) — lightweight convergence rule enforcement: trajectory monotonicity, minimum 3 clean passes, novelty ≤ 0.15 for CONVERGENCE_REACHED, zero-findings first pass warning
- **`validate-state-size.sh` hook** (20th) — warns at 200 lines, blocks at 500 lines (allows compaction writes that reduce size)
- **`check-state-health` skill + command** — 7-check diagnostic (existence, frontmatter, size, phase numbering, structure, content routing, convergence counter)
- **`compact-state` skill + command** — extracts historical content from bloated STATE.md to cycle-scoped files (burst-log, convergence-trajectory, session-checkpoints, lessons, blocking-issues-resolved)
- **Content routing rules** in state-manager agent — explicit routing tables and anti-patterns preventing STATE.md bloat
- **STATE.md health check** (check 8) wired into `factory-health` — catches bloat at every session start
- **CONVERGENCE.md Dimensions 6-7** — Visual Convergence (demo evidence) and Documentation Convergence (CHANGELOG, README, API docs)
- **Adversarial review template** updated with structured Novelty Assessment section (7 required fields)
- **State template v2.0** — Phase 0 included, size budget comment, Historical Content section, session checkpoint limit
- 68 new BATS tests across 3 new suites (state-health: 33, novelty-assessment: 18, convergence-tracker: 17)

### Fixed

- **Phase 1d step files** — rewrote 5 empty stubs into full alphabetic step files (a-e) with `_shared-context.md` containing Iron Law, Red Flags, convergence protocol, persistence protocol
- **Phase F5 step files** — enriched 8 thin files into full alphabetic step files (a-h) with `_shared-context.md` containing DF-025 walls, DF-013 multi-repo, holdout regression, security touchpoint
- **Orchestrator mandatory checks** — corrected all phase references (1d, 2, 3, 4, 5), added per-story and wave-level adversarial as mandatory steps
- **Stale phase references** swept across ~30 files: agents (7), docs (VSDD.md, FACTORY.md), templates (14), skills (4), lobster files (5), orchestrator sequences
- **CONVERGENCE.md autonomy config** — fixed phase numbering (3.5→4, 4→5, 5→6, 6→7)
- **adversary.md** — `model: opus` → `model: adversary`, "Phase 4" → "Phase 5"
- **Prompt template** renamed `phase-4-code-review.md` → `phase-5-code-review.md`
- **Template frontmatter** — 4 adversarial templates updated from `phase: 1d|2|4` to `1d|2|5`

### Changed

- 460 tests across 15 suites (was 392 across 12)
- 22 hooks (was 19)
- 116 skills (was 112), 108 commands (was 104)

## 0.40.0 — Full pipeline path verification + workflow mode documentation

### Added

- **docs/guide/pipeline-paths.md** — definitive routing reference documenting all 14 paths through the factory with step traces, gate criteria, Mermaid routing diagram, and transition logic
- **docs/guide/workflow-modes.md** — all 8 workflow modes with routing diagram, per-mode documentation, mode detection logic, greenfield→multi-repo and brownfield→multi-repo transition explanations
- **Greenfield→multi-repo transition** formalized as 4 lobster steps: topology-check, human-confirmation, repo-transition, state-migration
- **Brownfield→multi-repo auto hand-off** — `multi-repo-handoff-check` step detects if greenfield sub-workflow triggered multi-repo transition

### Fixed

- `wave-integration-gate` schema: `type: skill` → `type: compound` in greenfield + feature lobster (had no `skill:` path)
- Multi-repo `wave-0`/`wave-1` steps parameterized with `${repo.name}` and `${repo.mode}` (was hardcoded `api-server`/`frontend`)
- Brownfield `depends_on` on conditional steps: uses `wait_for_optional` for `semport-validation-gate` and `brownfield-design-system-approval`
- Maintenance description: updated from "9 sweep types" to "11 sweep types" (sweeps 10-11 were added but description not updated)
- Planning + multi-repo added to orchestrator Mode Detection and Reference Files table
- Mode-decision-guide: added multi-repo, maintenance, discovery to decision table + flowchart
- All "Phases 1-6" references updated to "Phases 1-7"

### Path Trace Results

14 paths traced. Zero broken file references. All `skill:` paths resolve, all `agent:` names resolve, all `sub_workflow:` references resolve.

## 0.39.0 — Workflow standardization + phase renumbering

### Changed

- **Phase renumbering**: Eliminated fractional Phase 3.5. Pipeline is now 8 phases (0-7): Codebase Ingestion, Spec Crystallization, Story Decomposition, TDD Implementation, Holdout Evaluation, Adversarial Refinement, Formal Hardening, Convergence.
- **Step decomposition**: All phases decomposed into step files with `_shared-context.md` and state-manager crash recovery. 30 step files across 5 work skills.
- **Three-layer architecture**: Top-level lobster → phase entry-point skill → phase sub-workflow lobster → step files.
- **Pure alphabetic step naming**: All step IDs use `step-a-`, `step-b-`, etc. No numeric or sub-step IDs.

### Added

- **8 phase entry-point skills** (`phase-0-codebase-ingestion` through `phase-7-convergence`) bridging top-level lobsters to phase sub-workflows
- **`phase-2-story-decomposition.lobster`** — previously missing phase sub-workflow
- **`rules/step-decomposition.md`** — comprehensive standard for phase numbering, step naming, workflow structure
- **8 structural BATS tests** for lobster path resolution, phase entry-point skills, no old numbering, shared-context, alphabetic naming
- Renamed `docs/guide/phase-4-adversarial-refinement.md` → `phase-5-adversarial-refinement.md`
- Renamed `docs/guide/phase-6-convergence-release.md` → `phase-7-convergence-release.md`

### Fixed

- **20 broken skill paths** in lobster workflow files (referenced non-existent phase skill directories)
- **~150 old phase number references** across 47 files
- `semport/SKILL.md` → `semport-analyze/SKILL.md` in brownfield.lobster
- README Mermaid diagram now shows all 8 phases
- Skills: 104 → 112, Workflows: 15 → 16, Rules: 8 → 9, Tests: 384 → 392

## 0.38.1 — Fix compute-input-hash path resolution

### Fixed

- **compute-input-hash** now searches `.factory/phase-0-ingestion/`, `.factory/stories/`, and `.factory/holdout-scenarios/` when resolving input paths. Previously only searched artifact dir, parent, specs/, and .factory/ root — causing silent partial hashes for artifacts referencing brownfield ingestion outputs, stories, or holdout scenarios.

### Added

- 3 new BATS tests for path resolution: phase-0-ingestion, stories, holdout-scenarios (Tests: 381 → 384)

## 0.38.0 — Orchestrator audit + workflow drift checks

### Added

- **Input-hash drift checks in lobster workflows** — phase-1, phase-3, phase-6 now include `input-hash-drift-check` step before gates/human approval
- **Orchestrator mandatory step** — input-hash drift check required at phase gates 1, 2, 3, 6
- **5 cross-cutting skills** added to orchestrator reference: `validate-template-compliance`, `conform-to-template`, `register-artifact`, `recover-state`, `factory-cycles-bootstrap`
- **validate-finding-format.sh** and **validate-input-hash.sh** detail sections in hooks-reference.md

### Changed

- README counts updated: 104 skills, 104 commands, 19 hooks, 94 templates, 5 bin helpers, 381 tests across 12 suites
- hooks-reference.md updated: 17 → 19 hooks with full detail sections
- configuration.md updated: 17 → 19 hooks in PostToolUse table

## 0.37.0 — Input-hash drift detection tooling

### Added

- **bin/compute-input-hash** — 7-char MD5 hash from `inputs:` files. `--update` writes to frontmatter, `--check` compares (exit 2 on drift).
- **validate-input-hash.sh** — PostToolUse hook warning on missing/stale input-hash. Advisory.
- **check-input-drift skill** — batch scan + report. Optional `--fix`.
- **22 BATS tests** for all three components.

### Changed

- Producer agents updated to compute input-hash after writing
- Hooks: 18 → 19, Tests: 359 → 380, Suites: 11 → 12, Skills: 103 → 105

## 0.36.0 — Strict ID enforcement + comprehensive ID reference

### Added

- **validate-finding-format.sh** — PostToolUse hook blocking legacy ADV-NNN, ADV-P[N]-NNN, and STORY-NNN-FIX formats. Only current formats accepted: `ADV-<CYCLE>-P[N]-[SEV]-NNN` and `FIX-P[N]-NNN`. 15 tests.
- **docs/guide/id-reference.md** — comprehensive reference documenting all 30 ID formats with scope rules, producer, registry, hook validation, and detailed descriptions for key IDs

### Changed

- **All migration graces removed.** Only current formats accepted:
  - `behavioral_contracts` (not `bcs`), `target_module` (not `crate`)
  - `document_type: domain-spec-index` (not `domain-spec-section`)
  - `SS-NN` IDs (not subsystem names)
  - Current table headers only (no legacy acceptance)
  - Legacy ADV/FIX ID formats removed from FACTORY.md
- **validate-story-bc-sync.sh** reads both `behavioral_contracts:` and `bcs:` functionally (finds data regardless of field name — template-compliance hook flags the wrong name separately)
- Hooks: 17 → 18, Tests: 342 → 359, Suites: 10 → 11

## 0.35.0 — Complete ID system formalization + Subsystem Registry

### Added

- **Subsystem Registry** in ARCH-INDEX template with formal SS-NN ID format, lifecycle documentation, and naming rules
- **31-entry ID Format Reference** in FACTORY.md (was 16) — every ID system in the plugin now formally documented
- **ID Scope Definitions** — Lifecycle (append-only), Cycle (resets), Local (scoped to parent)
- **Legacy ID Formats** migration table — ADV-NNN, STORY-NNN-FIX mapped to current formats
- **3 new templates:** holdout-scenario-index (HS-INDEX with WHS section), epic-index, fix
- **5 glossary terms:** Epic, Fix PR, Gap Register, ID Scope, Wave Holdout Scenario

### Changed

- **Subsystem references now use SS-NN IDs** (was human-readable names). BC `subsystem:` and story `subsystems:` fields hold SS-IDs, not names.
- **validate-subsystem-names.sh** hook matches SS-NN IDs against ARCH-INDEX registry. Error messages show `SS-01 (Core Engine)` pairs.
- **Language-agnostic terminology:** "Crate" → "module/package" across agents and templates. Story field `crate:` → `target_module:` (migration alias accepted).
- Templates: 124 → 127
- Policy 6 enforcement: validates SS-IDs, not names

## 0.34.0 — Template v1.1 schema update (Prism-validated improvements)

### Changed — Template Schema Updates

All changes are additive or header renames with migration acceptance. Existing artifacts remain valid.

- **behavioral-contract-template.md (v1.1):** Added `## Description` (required), `## Related BCs`, `## Architecture Anchors`, `## Story Anchor`, `## VP Anchors` (Recommended)
- **story-template.md (v1.1):** Added optional frontmatter: wave, crate, subsystems, estimated_days. UX Screens conditional. Table header simplifications with migration acceptance.
- **module-criticality-template.md (v1.1):** Added Module Inventory, Per-Module Risk Assessment, Dependency Graph, Implementation Priority, Cross-Cutting Concerns (Recommended), Anti-Patterns (Conditional)
- **verification-architecture-template.md (v1.1):** Sections allow inline OR reference-to-shard
- **L2-domain-spec-index-template.md (v1.1):** Clarified canonical document_type, strengthened sections: as REQUIRED

### Updated — Companion Changes

- product-owner and story-writer agents updated for v1.1 template guidance
- validate-template-compliance hook filters Recommended/Conditional sections

## 0.33.0 — Template compliance enforcement hook

### Added

- **validate-template-compliance.sh** — PostToolUse hook that automatically validates every Write to `.factory/**/*.md` against its corresponding template. Checks required frontmatter fields and H2 section headings. Resolves templates via `document_type` frontmatter or path-pattern fallback. Warning messages suggest `/vsdd-factory:conform-to-template` for fixes.
- **14 BATS tests** with 4 fixtures (compliant BC, non-compliant BC, non-compliant story, holdout with no frontmatter)

### Changed

- Hooks: 16 → 17
- Tests: 328 → 342 across 10 suites

### Context

Built in response to Prism template compliance audit showing 0% strict compliance across stories (76 FAIL) and holdout scenarios (8 FAIL). The hook catches these drift patterns at write time — agents see the warning immediately and can self-correct.

## 0.32.0 — Template compliance skills + hook integration audit

### Added

- **validate-template-compliance skill** — read-only audit checking artifact files against their templates at three levels: frontmatter fields, section headings, table column headers. Resolves templates via `document_type` frontmatter or file path patterns. Reports PASS/WARN/FAIL per file with aggregate summary.
- **conform-to-template skill** — remediation skill that fixes structural gaps by adding missing frontmatter fields, section headings, and `[TODO]` placeholders. Safety guarantees: never deletes content, always shows diff before applying, creates backup. Reports table/order mismatches for manual fix.
- **8 BATS tests** for both skills (structure, three-level check, mapping, safety guarantees, commands)

### Fixed

- **handoff-validator.sh:** Was reading `.result` / `.output` / `.tool_response` but Claude Code SubagentStop sends `last_assistant_message`. Hook was always seeing empty content. Fixed with correct field + legacy fallback.

### Changed

- Skills: 101 → 103, Commands: 101 → 103
- Tests: 319 → 328

### Hook Integration Audit Results

Verified all 16 hooks parse correct JSON fields per Claude Code documentation:
- Edit|Write hooks: `tool_input.file_path` — all 10 correct
- Bash hooks: `tool_input.command` — all 4 correct
- SubagentStop: `last_assistant_message` — fixed (was wrong)
- PostToolUse hooks correctly use exit 2 for prominent warnings (edits can't be undone)

## 0.31.0 — Template extraction + hook trigger fixes

### Added

- **12 new templates** extracted from inline format definitions:
  - HIGH: story-index, traceability-matrices, extraction-validation
  - MEDIUM: spec-drift-report, formal-verification, performance-report, implementation-readiness, design-drift, brief-validation, research-index
  - LOW: agent-file-review, consistency-validation-report
- **14 new BATS tests** for hook trigger edge cases:
  - check-factory-commit: 4 tests (was zero coverage)
  - red-gate: 3 absolute path tests
  - destructive-command-guard: 5 complex bash construct tests
  - verify-git-push: 2 edge case tests (--force-with-lease, -f at end)

### Fixed

- **verify-git-push:** `--force-with-lease` (safe force push) was incorrectly blocked because it substring-matched `--force`. Now allowed.
- **red-gate:** Absolute file paths from Claude Code tool_input never matched relative paths in `.red[]` array. Added PWD and git-root prefix stripping.

### Changed

- 13 agent/skill files updated to reference new templates instead of inline format definitions
- Templates: 112 → 124
- Tests: 305 → 319

## 0.30.2 — Generalize Policy 9 hook for multi-project portability

### Changed

- **validate-vp-consistency.sh Check (d):** Replaced hardcoded Kani/Proptest/Fuzz column detection with generic header-based discovery. Auto-detects ALL verification method columns from the Coverage by Module header row. Works for any tool names (Kani, CBMC, Hypothesis, fast-check, Stryker, etc.).
- **verification-coverage-matrix-template.md:** Method columns are now documented as project-specific with language-specific examples. Hook auto-detects — no configuration needed.
- Removed dependency on `.declared` temp file for Check (d) — uses `get_summary_total` directly with partial label matching.

## 0.30.1 — Fix Policy 9 hook defects + verification templates

### Fixed

- **validate-vp-consistency.sh Defect 1:** Multi-word Summary labels (e.g., "Integration test") triggered `set -u` abort on arithmetic comparison. All Policy 9 arithmetic enforcement (Checks c/d/e) was silently disabled. Fixed by normalizing labels to snake_case + defensive non-integer guard.
- **validate-vp-consistency.sh Defect 2:** EXIT trap clobbered non-zero exit codes to 0. Now preserves original rc through trap.
- **validate-vp-consistency.sh Defect 3:** Check (d) summed wrong columns (Criticality+Kani+Proptest, missing Fuzz). Replaced with header-detected column positions that find Kani/Proptest/Fuzz by name in the header row, handling any column layout.
- **Test fixtures** rebuilt from template format (was ad-hoc 5-column format that no project produces)

### Added

- **verification-coverage-matrix-template.md** — 7-column template with column definitions, arithmetic invariant rules, coverage gaps table, and domain invariant verification map
- **verification-architecture-template.md** — Provable Properties Catalog, P0/P1 lists, purity boundary, verification tooling tables
- **2 real-world regression tests** in policy9.bats (multi-word labels, fuzz column drift)
- **2 new test fixture sets** (policy-9-realworld, policy-9-fuzz-drift) matching template format

### Changed

- Architect agent references new templates for verification-coverage-matrix and verification-architecture sections
- Templates: 110 → 112

## 0.30.0 — Quality of life + comprehensive guardrails audit complete (Tier 5)

### Added

- **Policy reference matrix + violation playbook** (`docs/guide/policy-reference.md`) — single-page quick reference for all 9 policies with enforcement matrix (hook, criteria, agents) and per-policy step-by-step fix procedures
- **register-artifact skill** — automates INDEX file registration after creating BCs, VPs, stories, or holdout scenarios. Supports batch registration. 4 BATS tests.
- **recover-state skill** — reconstructs `.factory/STATE.md` from artifacts on disk when corrupted or missing. 9-step procedure with backup, artifact scanning, phase determination, user validation, and `--dry-run` option. 7 BATS tests.

### Changed

- Skills: 96 → 101, Commands: 96 → 101, Templates: 109 → 110
- Test count: 292 → 303 across 9 suites

### Audit Summary

This release completes the 5-tier comprehensive guardrails audit:
- **Tier 1 (v0.27.0):** 3 data safety hooks — destructive command guard, branch protection, factory branch guard
- **Tier 2 (v0.27.1):** 3 policy enforcement hooks — subsystem names, BC titles, story-BC sync
- **Tier 3 (v0.28.0):** All 33 agents standardized with Tool Access, Failure & Escalation, Remember, AGENT-SOUL.md
- **Tier 4 (v0.29.0):** 31 hook robustness + error contract tests, orchestrator FACTORY.md refs
- **Tier 5 (v0.30.0):** Policy reference docs, register-artifact skill, recover-state skill

Total impact: 16 hooks (was 11), 303 tests (was 133), 101 skills (was 96), all agents standardized.

## 0.29.0 — Testing gaps + orchestrator standardization (Tier 3-4)

### Added

- **FACTORY.md references** for all 9 orchestrator sequence files (brownfield, discovery, feature, greenfield, heartbeat, maintenance, multi-repo, per-story-delivery, steady-state)
- **hook-robustness.bats** — 31 tests verifying all 7 enforcement hooks handle: empty JSON, missing fields, nonexistent files, empty files, malformed frontmatter, and produce correct error contract (BLOCKED / POLICY N VIOLATION keywords)
- **BATS test** verifying all orchestrator files reference FACTORY.md

### Changed

- Test count: 260 → 292 across 9 suites
- README: updated test counts, suite counts, suite listings

## 0.28.0 — Agent standardization (Tier 3)

### Added

- **Tool Access sections** for 5 agents missing them: adversary (`read-only`), codebase-analyzer (`full`), holdout-evaluator (`restricted`), research-agent (`full`), validate-extraction (`full`)
- **Failure & Escalation sections** for 6 agents missing them (adversary, codebase-analyzer, holdout-evaluator, validate-extraction, implementer, plus research-agent already had one)
- **Remember + AGENT-SOUL.md closing** for all 5 newly standardized agents
- **4 structural completeness tests** — verify ALL 33 agents have: Tool Access, Failure & Escalation, Remember, AGENT-SOUL.md reference
- **5 profile tests** for newly documented agent profiles

### Changed

- Test count: 251 → 260 across 8 suites
- All 33 agents now have consistent structure: Tool Access, Failure & Escalation, Remember, AGENT-SOUL.md

## 0.27.1 — Policy enforcement hooks (Tier 2)

### Added

- **validate-subsystem-names.sh** (Policy 6) — PostToolUse hook verifying BC `subsystem:` and story `subsystems:` fields match ARCH-INDEX Subsystem Registry canonical names. Error messages list all valid names.
- **validate-bc-title.sh** (Policy 7) — PostToolUse hook verifying BC file H1 heading matches BC-INDEX title column. Shows both titles on mismatch.
- **validate-story-bc-sync.sh** (Policy 8) — PostToolUse hook verifying bidirectional BC completeness between story frontmatter `bcs:` array, body BC table, and AC trace annotations. Identifies specific missing BCs.
- **28 BATS tests** for all three hooks with shared fixtures (ARCH-INDEX, BC-INDEX, good/bad BC and story files)

### Changed

- Hook count: 13 → 16
- Test count: 223 → 251 across 8 suites
- hooks-reference.md, configuration.md: updated with all new hooks

### Analysis (Finding #6 conclusions)

Policies 1-5 remain gate-only (consistency-validator criteria). Research confirmed:
- Policy 1 (append_only_numbering): requires git history scan — too expensive for edit-time
- Policy 2 (lift_invariants_to_bcs): requires cross-file scan of all BCs — blocks intermediate states
- Policy 3 (state_manager_runs_last): temporal ordering — not a file-content check
- Policy 4 (semantic_anchoring_integrity): requires semantic judgment — only adversary can assess
- Policy 5 (creators_justify_anchors): can check presence but not correctness — adversary review is appropriate

## 0.27.0 — Data safety hooks (Tier 1)

### Added

- **destructive-command-guard.sh** — PreToolUse Bash hook blocking `rm -rf` on protected paths (.factory/, src/, tests/), `rm` on source-of-truth files (STATE.md, *-INDEX.md, prd.md), `git reset --hard`, `git clean -f`, `git checkout -- .`, `git restore .`, `git rm` on spec/story paths. Each block message includes the safe alternative. 46 BATS tests.
- **factory-branch-guard.sh** — PreToolUse Edit|Write hook blocking writes to `.factory/` when not mounted as git worktree on `factory-artifacts` branch. Also guards `.factory-project/` for multi-repo projects. Block messages include the exact recovery command. 6 BATS tests.
- **verify-git-push.sh** enhanced — now blocks direct push to protected branches (main, master, develop) in addition to force push. Block messages suggest the PR workflow. 10 BATS tests.

### Changed

- Hook count: 10 → 13
- Test count: 161 → 223 across 7 suites
- hooks-reference.md: complete rewrite covering all 13 hooks with detail sections
- configuration.md: updated hook tables with all new hooks
- README: updated hook count, test count, suite count, suite listings

## 0.26.0 — Policy registry, cycle management, scoped reviews

### Added

- **Policy registry** (`/vsdd-factory:policy-registry`) — declarative `.factory/policies.yaml` with init, list, validate, show commands. 9 baseline policies with `verification_steps` field providing step-by-step check procedures the adversary executes per-policy.
- **Policy add** (`/vsdd-factory:policy-add`) — register new governance policies mid-cycle with schema validation, sequential ID assignment, and verification steps
- **policies-template.yaml** — complete template with 9 baseline policies, verification steps, lint hook references, and scope declarations
- **Adversarial-review policy auto-loading** — orchestrator reads `policies.yaml` and injects full policy rubric (with verification steps) into every adversary dispatch, replacing manual copy-pasting
- **Cycle layout bootstrap** (`/vsdd-factory:factory-cycles-bootstrap`) — migrate from flat `specs/adversarial-review-pass-*.md` layout to cycle-keyed directories with `git mv` for history preservation
- **Scoped adversarial review** (`--scope` parameter) — `full` (default), `diff-from:<commit>` (focus on changed files), `paths:<pattern>` (target specific subsystems)
- **Cycle-prefixed finding IDs** — `ADV-<CYCLE>-P<PASS>-<SEV>-<SEQ>` format prevents ID collisions across multi-cycle projects

### Changed

- **adversarial-review** `disable-model-invocation` set to `false` — enables orchestrator-initiated invocation for autonomous convergence loops
- **Orchestrator** updated with policy rubric loading directive and new cross-cutting skills
- Finding ID format in 4 templates updated from `ADV-P[N]-NNN` to cycle-prefixed format
- README: test count 152 → 161, skills.bats 24 → 33

## 0.25.0 — Policy 9 lint hook + adversarial-review skill hardening

### Added

- **Policy 9 lint hook** (`hooks/validate-vp-consistency.sh`) — PostToolUse hook that validates VP-INDEX.md ↔ verification-architecture.md ↔ verification-coverage-matrix.md consistency on every edit. Checks: (a) every VP-INDEX VP appears in both arch docs, (b) per-tool summary totals match row counts, (c) coverage matrix Totals row matches data row sums, (d) no orphaned VP references in coverage matrix. Wired into hooks.json PostToolUse.
- **Architect source-of-truth invariants table** — consolidates ARCH-INDEX (subsystem names), BC H1 (titles), VP-INDEX (VP catalog) as the three authoritative sources with their downstream documents. Cross-links to validate-vp-consistency.sh as automated enforcer.
- **Adversarial-review post-adversary persistence** — explicit orchestrator step to capture adversary findings and dispatch state-manager to persist them to `.factory/cycles/<cycle>/adversarial-reviews/pass-<N>.md`. Prevents findings loss when adversary (read-only agent) returns chat text that disappears on session boundary.
- **Adversarial-review filename collision guard** — pre-flight check refuses to overwrite existing review files with different content. Points to cycle bootstrap skill for resolution. Warns about legacy flat-file layout.
- **11 BATS tests** for Policy 9 hook (3 fixture sets: green, canary with fuzz column drift, missing-VP)
- **3 BATS tests** for adversarial-review persistence + collision guard presence

### Changed

- README: test count 138 → 152, suite count 5 → 6
- run-all.sh: includes policy9.bats suite

## 0.24.1 — Policy 9: VP-INDEX source of truth

### Added

- **Policy 9: `vp_index_is_vp_catalog_source_of_truth`** — VP-INDEX.md is the authoritative VP enumeration; changes must propagate to verification-architecture.md and verification-coverage-matrix.md in the same burst
- **Architect agent:** VP-INDEX propagation obligation — must touch VP-INDEX AND both architecture anchor docs in the same output
- **Adversary agent:** VP-INDEX ↔ architecture document coherence review axis (4-point verification: self-consistency, catalog match, coverage matrix match, reverse check)
- **Product-owner agent:** VP citation change handoff — notes arch-doc propagation obligation when VP citations change in BCs
- **Consistency-validator criteria 78-80:** VP-INDEX self-consistency (arithmetic), VP-INDEX → verification-architecture.md completeness, VP-INDEX → verification-coverage-matrix.md completeness
- **5 BATS tests** for policy 9 presence in architect, adversary, product-owner, consistency-validator, FACTORY.md
- **Glossary term:** VP-INDEX Source of Truth

### Changed

- Consistency-validator criteria count: 77 → 80
- Session-review template: added policy 9 to governance policy audit checklist
- README: test count 133 → 138

## 0.24.0 — 8 governance policies formalized + permission model regression tests

### Added

- **Governance policy registry** in FACTORY.md — 8 top-level integrity policies with enforcing agents, validation criteria, and severity floors
- **8 governance policies** formally integrated into agent prompts:
  - `append_only_numbering` — IDs never renumbered, filename slugs immutable (product-owner, spec-steward, criterion 77)
  - `lift_invariants_to_bcs` — every DI-NNN must be cited by at least one BC (product-owner, adversary, criterion 74)
  - `state_manager_runs_last` — already present, verified across all agents
  - `semantic_anchoring_integrity` — formalized as criteria 70-73 (was unnumbered)
  - `creators_justify_anchors` — added to business-analyst for CAP-NNN creation
  - `architecture_is_subsystem_name_source_of_truth` — added product-owner BC subsystem validation, criterion 76
  - `bc_h1_is_title_source_of_truth` — added product-owner enrichment rule, adversary title sync axis, criterion 75
  - `bc_array_changes_propagate_to_body_and_acs` — story-writer, product-owner, adversary, criteria 67-69
- **permissions.bats** — new test suite (53 tests) covering agent permission model and governance policy presence
  - Profile enforcement: spec producers `coding`, code producers `full`, coordinators restricted
  - Tool-profile coherence: coding-profile agents have no shell commands in code blocks or inline backticks
  - Policy presence: each of 8 policies verified in correct agent prompts
- **Consistency-validator criteria 67-77** — 11 new validation criteria for governance policy enforcement
- **3 new adversary review axes** — BC title/subsystem sync, invariant-to-BC orphan detection, story frontmatter-body coherence
- **Glossary terms** — Append-Only Numbering, Governance Policy, Invariant Lifting

### Changed

- **accessibility-auditor** profile: `coding` → `full` (needs shell for axe-core, lighthouse, pa11y, eslint jsx-a11y)
- **FACTORY.md** permission model table: added "Tool-based reviewers" row for accessibility-auditor
- **Consistency-validator** criteria count: 66 → 77
- **Session-review template**: governance policy audit section expanded to cover all 8 policies
- **Cycle-manifest template**: added "Governance Policies Adopted" section
- **README.md**: test count 62 → 133, suite count 3 → 5

### Fixed

- **story-writer** pre-commit verification: changed "grep the story file" to "read the story file" (story-writer has `coding` profile, no shell access)
- **accessibility-auditor** tool-profile mismatch: was told to run `npx` commands but had `coding` profile (no exec)

## 0.23.0 — Comprehensive documentation update + Prism lessons + DTU taxonomy + agent permission model

### Added
- **12 Prism Phase 3 lessons** codified across agents and skills:
  - State-manager-last ordering, path-prefix verification, burst splitting (>8 artifacts), BC anchor-back in same burst
  - Fresh-context consistency audit at every gate, universal DTU integration surface taxonomy, BC retirement checklist, trajectory monotonicity, single source of truth rule
  - Structured human review questions at every gate, minimum 3 clean passes for convergence
- **Universal DTU integration surface taxonomy** — 6 mandatory categories (inbound data, outbound operations, identity & access, persistence & state, observability & export, enrichment & lookup) replacing project-specific categories
- **Agent permission model** documented in FACTORY.md, agents-reference, and configuration guide — spec producers (coding), code producers (full), coordinators (restricted), infrastructure (full)
- **Semantic Anchoring Integrity** — adversary, consistency-validator, product-owner, story-writer, architect enforce semantic correctness of all anchors
- **DTU assessment gate** mandatory in Phase 1 (P1-06) with pre-Phase 4 clone existence check
- **CI/CD deferred to post-architecture** (P1-06b) with pre-Phase 4 verification gate

### Changed
- **Getting-started guide** now includes `/activate` as Step 2, scaffold-claude-md as Step 5
- **Cross-cutting skills guide** expanded from ~25 to all 96 skills organized into 20 categories
- **Commands reference** expanded from ~47 to all 96 commands organized by category
- **Phase 1 guide** documents mandatory DTU assessment, CI/CD setup, anchor justification, consistency audit
- **Pipeline overview** documents DTU gate, CI/CD gate, consistency audit, pre-Phase 4 gates
- **README counts** corrected: commands 47→96, agents 34→33, templates 108→109

### Fixed
- **Command files** use colon syntax (`vsdd-factory:skill-name`) — was space syntax causing "Unknown skill" errors
- **Delegation commands** route through orchestrator instead of bouncing
- **Agent permissions** — product-owner, story-writer, architect reverted to `coding` profile (state-manager owns `.factory/` commits)
- **All project-specific references** removed from agent and skill files — generic examples only
- **Session-reviewer** agent name corrected throughout (was `session-review`)

## 0.22.0 — Semantic Anchoring Integrity

### Added
- **Adversary: Semantic Anchoring Audit** — new scan category verifying anchors are semantically correct, not just syntactically valid. 4-level severity matrix (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW). Mis-anchoring ALWAYS blocks convergence — never deferred as "Observation."
- **Consistency-validator: Anchor Semantic Audit** — verifies BC↔capability, story↔subsystem, VP↔anchor_story, and traceability table semantic correctness beyond structural ID matching
- **Product-owner: Anchor Justification Requirement** — must explicitly justify capability anchor choice citing source-of-truth when creating/modifying BCs
- **Story-writer: Anchor Justification Requirement** — must justify subsystem, dependency, and VP anchor choices with specific technical reasons
- **Architect: Anchor Justification Requirement** — must justify ADR references, subsystem assignments, and crate ownership claims. Planned-but-not-created crates must be marked `[PLANNED]`

## 0.21.0 — Orchestrator sync

### Fixed
- **Agent routing table** — added missing `codebase-analyzer` and `validate-extraction` agents, fixed `session-review` → `session-reviewer` to match agent filename, removed duplicate `product-owner` entry
- **Agents reference doc** — corrected `session-review` → `session-reviewer`

### Added
- **Cross-cutting skills reference** in orchestrator — table of 9 skills available at any pipeline point (scaffold-claude-md, visual-companion, create-excalidraw, systematic-debugging, writing-skills, validate-consistency, spec-drift, research, track-debt)

### Changed
- **State-manager delegation description** updated — orchestrator now documents that state-manager owns `.factory/` commits directly (no devops-engineer roundtrip)

## 0.20.1 — State-manager direct git commits

### Changed
- **State-manager now has shell access** for direct `.factory/` git commits. No longer spawns devops-engineer for every STATE.md update. Shell access is scoped: git commands inside `.factory/` only, no non-git commands, no source code branches.

## 0.20.0 — CI/CD deferred to post-architecture

### Changed
- **CI/CD setup moved out of repo-initialization** — repo-init no longer creates CI/CD workflows because the tech stack is unknown at init time. CI/CD is now a separate mandatory step (`phase-1-cicd-setup`) that runs after architecture determines the language, framework, and deployment topology.

### Added
- **Mandatory CI/CD setup step** (P1-06b) — devops-engineer creates `.github/workflows/` (ci.yml, release.yml, security.yml) based on architecture output, updates branch protection with CI status checks, produces `cicd-setup.md`
- **CI/CD criteria in Phase 1 gate** — ci.yml must exist, cicd-setup.md must exist, branch protection must require CI checks
- **Pre-Phase 4 CI/CD gate** — verifies CI pipeline exists and runs successfully before implementation begins
- CI/CD added to orchestrator's mandatory steps list (never skip, never conditional)

## 0.19.0 — Complete command coverage + activate agent ID fix

### Added
- **49 missing command files** — every skill now has a corresponding slash command for full autocomplete coverage
- Delegation reference commands (12) route through the orchestrator instead of bouncing
- Execution commands (37) invoke skills directly via the Skill tool

### Fixed
- **Activate skill writes correct 3-segment agent ID** (`vsdd-factory:orchestrator:orchestrator`). The 2-segment form (`vsdd-factory:orchestrator`) silently fell back to plain Claude because the orchestrator lives in a subdirectory.
- **Delegation command files** (dtu-creation, guided-brief-creation) now route through the orchestrator instead of trying to execute delegation-reference skills directly

## 0.18.0 — DTU assessment gate enforcement + command syntax fix

### Added
- **DTU assessment is now mandatory** (P1-06) — always produces `dtu-assessment.md`, even if the answer is "DTU_REQUIRED: false" with rationale. Prevents silent skip that occurred in Prism.
- **DTU checks in Phase 2 gate** — `dtu-assessment.md` must exist, fidelity classifications required if DTU_REQUIRED, rationale required if not
- **Pre-Phase 4 DTU clone existence gate** — if DTU_REQUIRED: true, verifies clones are built and validated before implementation begins
- **Mandatory steps list** in orchestrator — explicit "never skip, never conditional" list covering DTU assessment, adversarial convergence, holdout evaluation
- **DTU status in STATE.md** — state-manager writes `dtu_required`, `dtu_assessment`, `dtu_clones_built`, `dtu_services` fields for visibility across sessions

### Fixed
- **All 47 command files** now use colon syntax (`vsdd-factory:skill-name`) instead of space syntax (`vsdd-factory skill-name`). The space syntax caused "Unknown skill" errors when commands delegated to skills via the Skill tool.

## 0.17.0 — Prism Phase 3 lessons learned

### Added
- **8 lessons from Prism Phase 3 adversarial convergence** (29 passes, 46 stories, 167 BCs, 38 VPs) codified across 6 agent/skill files:
  - **story-writer:** must read source BC files (not summaries), use centralized version pins from dependency-graph.md, include forbidden dependencies section, use only existing error codes from taxonomy, pre-validate new stories against invariant list
  - **adversary:** accumulate confirmed invariants across passes (monotonically growing list)
  - **adversarial-review:** fix root causes not symptoms (rewrite from BC, don't patch lines), accumulate invariants, pre-validate new scope additions
  - **implementer:** fix root causes from BC source, read before editing and verify after editing
  - **deliver-story:** verify every fix landed correctly (read file, grep for pattern, check for side effects)
  - **create-story:** centralized version pins, forbidden dependencies section, error taxonomy compliance

## 0.16.1 — Reference manifest template + documentation fixes

### Added
- **reference-manifest-template.yaml** — standardized template for `.factory/reference-manifest.yaml` combining corverax and vsdd-factory formats (url, commit SHA, ingested date, depth, focus, status)
- End-user guide for visual companion (`docs/guide/visual-companion.md`) with Mermaid workflow diagrams

### Fixed
- Brownfield-ingest skill now references the template for manifest format
- Removed stale `/vsdd-factory:excalidraw-export` reference from visual companion See Also
- Added visual companion to README documentation table

## 0.16.0 — Excalidraw integration + visual companion testing

### Added
- **Excalidraw integration** in visual companion — `.excalidraw` files render as interactive canvases in the browser with user editing and WebSocket save-back
- **create-excalidraw skill** (`/vsdd-factory:create-excalidraw`) — generate `.excalidraw` JSON files for architecture diagrams, entity relationships, and flow charts
- **History sidebar** — collapsible panel showing all past screens (HTML and excalidraw), click to navigate
- **Composed views** — `screen.json` manifest for multi-pane layouts (split, side-by-side)
- **setup.sh** — one-time setup script installs React + excalidraw dependencies and builds the viewer
- **18 visual companion tests** — server routes, file-type detection, API endpoints, file serving
- React app scaffold (Vite + React 18 + @excalidraw/excalidraw v0.18)

### Fixed
- Server `__ACTIVE_FILE__` and `__MANIFEST__` injection now uses script tag insertion instead of string replacement
- Tiered visual tooling tables corrected across 5 files — replaced incorrect excalidraw-export reference with proper tiers (visual-companion excalidraw mode, create-excalidraw standalone, Mermaid, ASCII)

### Changed
- Visual companion server now supports `.html`, `.excalidraw`, and `screen.json` file types (was HTML-only)
- `/api/files` endpoint returns all screen files with metadata
- `/api/drawing/<name>` endpoint serves raw excalidraw JSON
- `/html/<name>` endpoint serves individual HTML files (for iframe embedding)
- Test suite now 80 tests across 4 suites (was 62 across 3)

## 0.15.0 — Systematic debugging, verification discipline, and writing-skills

### Added
- **systematic-debugging skill** — 4-phase root cause investigation process adapted from superpowers, with BC-aware debugging and "3+ fixes = architectural problem" escalation rule
- **writing-skills skill** — TDD methodology for creating and maintaining skills (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR applied to process documentation), with CSO guidance and rationalization resistance patterns
- **Verification discipline** — deliver-story and per-story-delivery now enforce independent verification of agent claims before proceeding (agent reports are claims, test output is evidence)
- **Review feedback guidance** — implementer and test-writer agents now have explicit guidance for receiving code review (verify before implementing, push back when wrong, BC is source of truth)

### Documentation
- Getting started guide now includes scaffold-claude-md as Step 4
- Cross-cutting skills guide documents visual-companion, systematic-debugging, and writing-skills
- Phase 1 guide documents visual tooling and self-review checklists
- Phase 2 guide documents scope check, plan failures, and self-review
- Phase 3 guide documents verification discipline, agent status protocol, model selection, review feedback handling, and debugging reference
- Agents reference documents the standard status protocol and self-review
- README skill count updated to 95

## 0.14.0 — Agent dispatch quality gaps

### Added
- **Standard agent status protocol** (DONE/DONE_WITH_CONCERNS/NEEDS_CONTEXT/BLOCKED) — agents-md-template, implementer, test-writer, pr-manager all report structured status codes
- **"Over your head" escalation language** — agents-md-template, implementer, test-writer explicitly encourage early escalation over bad work
- **Pre-handoff self-review checklists** — implementer (completeness, TDD, YAGNI), test-writer (coverage, behavior vs implementation, naming), pr-manager (description accuracy, traceability, demo evidence)
- **Model selection guidance** — deliver-story and per-story-delivery.md include tier mapping (fast/standard/capable) per dispatch task type
- **Extended Red Flags** — deliver-story adds 4 new dispatch anti-patterns (parallel dispatch, shared agents, skipped reviews, same-model retry)

## 0.13.0 — Story decomposition quality gaps

### Added
- **Hard gate language** — decompose-stories and create-story block premature implementation
- **Scope decomposition check** — decompose-stories verifies PRD describes a single product before breaking it down
- **"Plan Failures" anti-pattern list** — both skills explicitly ban "TBD", vague error handling, untestable ACs, and 4 other story-invalidating patterns
- **Self-review checklists** — decompose-stories checks spec coverage, consistency, and sizing; create-story checks completeness, testability, and context budget
- **Execution reference** in story template — points to `/vsdd-factory:deliver-story STORY-NNN`

## 0.12.0 — Early-phase quality gaps + visual companion

### Added
- **visual-companion skill** (`/vsdd-factory:visual-companion`) — browser-based mockups, diagrams, and interactive A/B choices during brainstorming, brief creation, and architecture design. Ported from superpowers. Optional, requires Node.js.
- **Tiered visual tooling strategy** — early-phase skills auto-detect available tools (visual-companion → excalidraw-export → Mermaid → ASCII) with no hard dependencies
- **Pre-adversarial self-review checklist** — added to create-brief, create-prd, create-architecture, and create-domain-spec to catch obvious gaps before the expensive adversary loop
- **Hard gate language** — explicit "do NOT skip to next phase" guards in brainstorming, guided-brief-creation, create-brief, create-prd, and create-architecture
- **Anti-pattern + Red Flags table** — brainstorming skill now calls out the "too simple to brainstorm" rationalization with a 7-row cognitive trap table

### Changed
- FACTORY.md documents visual companion in project tooling section
- VSDD.md references visual companion in Tooling section

## 0.11.0 — CLAUDE.md scaffolding skill

### Added
- **scaffold-claude-md skill** (`/vsdd-factory:scaffold-claude-md`) — auto-detects project language, build/test/lint commands, git workflow, and project references to generate a project-specific `CLAUDE.md`
- Activate skill now suggests `scaffold-claude-md` when no `CLAUDE.md` exists
- Optional `scaffold-claude-md` step in greenfield and brownfield workflows

### Changed
- FACTORY.md documents CLAUDE.md scaffolding in project setup section
- VSDD.md references the new skill in Tooling section

## 0.10.3 — Release infrastructure and CI/CD

### Added
- **Release workflow** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) — tag-triggered validation + GitHub Release with CHANGELOG excerpt
- **Release config** (`.factory/release-config.yaml`) — declarative release manifest on factory-artifacts branch
- **Release skill rewrite** — config-driven, 3 modes (init/release/dry-run), quality gate spectrum
- Retroactive git tags and GitHub Releases for all 12 prior versions (v0.1.0 through v0.10.2)
- Version field in marketplace.json for release validation
- Factory-artifacts mount step in CI and release workflows

### Changed
- CI workflow renamed from `plugin-validation.yml` to `ci.yml` for cross-repo consistency
- Bump `actions/checkout` from v4 to v6 (Node.js 20 deprecation)

## 0.10.2 — Template path portability fix

Closes a portability hole that would have broken clean installs.

### The bug

Skills and agents referenced templates as `.claude/templates/<name>.md` — a path that only exists inside corverax, where the plugin was originally developed and `.claude/templates/` is pre-populated. A clean install of vsdd-factory into any other project would ship the templates at `plugins/vsdd-factory/templates/` (where they actually live) but every skill referencing `.claude/templates/...` would fail the lookup.

59 references across 24 files were affected:

- 20 skills: `research`, `semport-analyze`, `brownfield-ingest`, `create-brief`, `create-story`, `create-domain-spec`, `create-architecture`, `create-prd`, `adversarial-review`, `holdout-eval`, `state-update`, `record-demo`, `pr-create`, `decompose-stories`, `track-debt`, `convergence-check`, `validate-consistency`, `deliver-story`, `dtu-validate`, `formal-verify`
- 4 agents: `validate-extraction`, `research-agent`, `adversary`, `holdout-evaluator`

### The fix

All 59 references rewritten from `.claude/templates/<name>` to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/<name>` — the Claude Code canonical environment variable for the plugin root directory. Agents shell-expand the variable when reading via bash, and the path resolves to the real template location that ships with the plugin regardless of install target.

### Regression guards (3 new tests)

`tests/skills.bats` grew a "Template path portability" section with three tests:

- `no skill references the non-portable .claude/templates/ path` — grep-based regression guard
- `no agent references the non-portable .claude/templates/ path` — same
- `every referenced template actually exists in plugin templates/` — extracts every `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/<file>` reference from skills and agents, strips the prefix, and asserts the file exists at `plugins/vsdd-factory/templates/<file>`. Caught zero dangling references on first run.

Test suite now **62 tests**, all pass.

### Note for future skill authors

When citing a template in a new skill or agent, use:

```
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/<name>.md` — <description>
```

The `.claude/templates/` prefix is never portable and is now a test failure.

## 0.10.1 — Step-file content fill

Closes the last deferred item from 0.9.0: empty `steps/` placeholder stubs in three skills now carry real per-step playbooks.

### 17 step files expanded (1566 LOC)

The three facilitation / inspection skills (`brainstorming`, `artifact-detection`, `guided-brief-creation`) had `## Step-File Decomposition` tables referencing per-step files that were 3-6 line placeholders. The parent SKILL.md carried the high-level flow; the step files existed only as stubs.

Each step file is now a 58-130 line self-contained playbook the orchestrator can load on demand when executing that specific step. Structure per file:

- **Inputs** — what previous steps produced, files to read, expected state
- **Outputs** — exact artifact paths and formats
- **Procedure** — specific moves, exact elicitation questions (for facilitation skills), exact commands and glob patterns (for inspection skills)
- **Decision points** — branches with criteria, where applicable
- **Failure modes** — step-level failures (distinct from whole-skill failures in parent SKILL.md)
- **Quality gate** — short checklist before advancing
- **Hand-off** — what to pass to the next step

**brainstorming (6 files, 487 LOC):** session setup, technique selection, facilitated ideation, synthesis, direction selection, report writing. Includes exact opening questions, transition phrases, SCAMPER/reverse-brainstorming/mind-mapping/constraint-removal scripts, and the verbatim markdown template for `brainstorming-report.md`.

**artifact-detection (5 files, 510 LOC):** scan, classify, validate, gap analysis, route decision. Includes exact glob patterns per artifact type, explicit validation checklists (rewritten from the SKILL.md prose as iterable rules), DF-020/DF-021 format-migration handling, and verbatim templates for `artifact-inventory.md`, `gap-analysis.md`, and `routing-decision.md`.

**guided-brief-creation (6 files, 569 LOC):** understand intent, contextual discovery, guided elicitation, draft review, adversarial review, finalize. Includes exact section-by-section elicitation questions, research-agent / adversary dispatch criteria, market-intel integration points, and verbatim structures for `product-brief.md` and `elicitation-notes.md`.

### Cross-step dependencies surfaced

Step files make explicit several dependencies that were implicit in the prose:

- **artifact-detection format flags propagate** — format detection in step 1b (FR-NNN vs BC-S.SS.NNN, old vs DF-021-sharded architecture) flows into step 3 validation rules and step 5 routing decisions
- **guided-brief-creation market-intel reference** — `market-intel.md` is read in step 3 and again in step 5 adversarial review for differentiation and risk signals
- **guided-brief-creation adversarial loopback** — step 5 feedback can send the agent back to step 3 (re-elicitation) or step 4 (redraft)

### Meta

- No SKILL.md files modified. Step-file decomposition tables unchanged.
- All 59 tests still pass. No new tests added for step-file content (content is prose, not behavior).
- Full analysis report at `.factory/semport/STEPS-REPORT.md`.

## 0.10.0 — Deferred remediation: commands, hook envelopes, structural tests

Closes out the remaining P1/P2 items deferred from 0.9.0.

### Commands directory (47 files)

Prior versions exposed skills only — many with `disable-model-invocation: true`, which meant users had no slash-command entry point for phase transitions, health checks, or delivery. This release ships `plugins/vsdd-factory/commands/` with **47 thin slash-command wrappers**, one per user-facing skill.

Each command is 15-30 lines: frontmatter (description + optional `argument-hint` mirrored from the skill) and a body that delegates via `Use the <skill-name> skill via the Skill tool`. Commands are entry points; skills remain the source of truth.

Coverage: all Phase 0-6 lifecycle skills (brownfield-ingest, semport-analyze, create-brief through release), cross-cutting ops (factory-health, track-debt, worktree-manage), and UI/design skills (design-system-bootstrap, ui-quality-gate, etc.).

### Hook upgrade: permissionDecision envelopes (POC on spec-steward)

`hooks/protect-vp.sh` and `hooks/protect-bc.sh` now emit `PreToolUse` JSON envelopes with `permissionDecision` + `permissionDecisionReason` instead of bare exit codes. The denial reasons are richer and instruct the agent to create a superseding artifact rather than just blocking the edit.

This is a POC on the two spec-steward hooks. The other hooks (`brownfield-discipline`, `red-gate`, `purity-check`, etc.) still use exit codes. Upgrading them requires per-hook design — deferred until a specific need motivates each one.

Tests updated: the two "blocks edit to green X" tests now assert `status -eq 0` with `permissionDecision:deny` in stdout, replacing the old `status -eq 2` stderr check.

### Structural tests for Iron Laws and Red Flags (18 new tests)

New `tests/skills.bats` enforces that the four discipline skills carry their behavior-shaping scaffolding. A discipline skill missing its Iron Law, "Announce at start" line, or Red Flags table is now a test failure — empirically load-bearing content cannot silently rot.

Test coverage per skill:
- `deliver-story`, `brownfield-ingest`, `adversarial-review`, `wave-gate`: Iron Law token + `## The Iron Law` section + `## Announce at Start` section + `## Red Flags` table with ≥8 rows
- `brownfield-ingest` specifically: Honest Convergence clause, Known Round-1 Hallucination Classes, Subagent Delivery Protocol (`=== FILE:` delimiter), Behavioral vs Metric split, Priority-ordered Lessons mandate
- `validate-extraction` agent: Behavioral vs Metric operating mode with Phase 1 / Phase 2 sections

Total suite: **59 tests** (41 pre-existing + 18 new). All pass.

### Name collision fix

`agents/session-review.md` renamed to `agents/session-reviewer.md` to disambiguate from the `skills/session-review/` directory. Non-breaking — no referring files use the old basename (verified via grep).

### Deferred

Placeholder `steps/` stubs in `brainstorming`, `artifact-detection`, and `guided-brief-creation` skills are still empty. These need real content (not a mechanical fix); tracked for a scoped content PR.

Non-spec-steward hooks remain on exit-code semantics until a per-hook motivation exists for the envelope upgrade.

## 0.9.0 — Self-ingest remediation: apply lessons from claude-code + superpowers

Applies the P0/P1 lessons from running the plugin's own `brownfield-ingest` protocol against `anthropics/claude-code` and `obra/superpowers` in the `.factory/semport/` analysis. The ingest caught 3 round-1 hallucinations via strict-binary novelty, which validated both the protocol and specific gaps in the plugin itself.

### Agent frontmatter remediation (Group A — 46 files)

- **26 agent descriptions rewritten** from the boilerplate stub `VSDD factory agent: <name>` to one-sentence "Use when..." triggers drawn from each agent's body, following superpowers' CSO rule (third-person, when-not-what, <1024 chars).
- **`model:` field added to 28 agents.** Defaults to `sonnet`. Exceptions on `opus`: `adversary`, `holdout-evaluator`, `formal-verifier`, `pr-reviewer`, `spec-reviewer` — terminal reviewers where reasoning quality dominates call volume.
- **`color:` field added to all 33 root agents**, grouped by function: reviewers=red, builders=green, planners=blue, ops=yellow, research=purple.
- **`implementer.md` description** fixed (was truncated mid-sentence).
- **9 `agents/orchestrator/` include files** gained YAML frontmatter with `disable-model-invocation: true` so strict loaders no longer trip on them.
- **`excalidraw-export` and `jira` SKILLs** gained frontmatter (reference-only, `disable-model-invocation: true`).
- **`state-update` skill** marked `disable-model-invocation: true` (internal).

### deliver-story dispatch rewrite (Group B)

`skills/deliver-story/SKILL.md` was a single-context script that quietly drifted from the `agents/orchestrator/per-story-delivery.md` workflow it was supposed to use. Rewritten as a thin dispatcher:

- Declares itself a dispatcher, not an implementer, via `EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT` block.
- Iron Law: `NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT RED GATE VERIFICATION FIRST`.
- Prerequisites check that STOPs on failure (no silent bypass).
- 9-step dispatch sequence: devops-engineer → test-writer (stubs) → test-writer (tests) → **independent Red Gate verification** → implementer → demo-recorder → implementer (push) → pr-manager → devops-engineer (cleanup) → state update.
- Context discipline table naming which files each specialist receives (prevents topic drift from passing whole-story context to every agent).
- Story split recovery flow for oversized PRs.
- 10-row Red Flags table targeting the rationalizations that lead back to single-context execution.
- `agents/orchestrator/per-story-delivery.md` header marked as canonical source.

### brownfield-ingest self-improvements (Group C)

Codifies the 5 lessons the ingest protocol taught itself when applied to real reference repos:

- **Honest Convergence clause** — mandatory verbatim text in every round prompt: "<3 substantive → declare converged, emit no file." Stops agents from fabricating findings under pressure to produce SUBSTANTIVE output.
- **Known Round-1 Hallucination Classes** — 5 named failure modes (over-extrapolated token lists, miscounted enumerations, named pattern conflation, same-basename artifact conflation, inflated/deflated metrics) with verbatim examples from superpowers round 1 (persuasion matrix, Pressure Taxonomy, writing-plans forbidden tokens). Round 2+ prompts must audit round 1 against these classes.
- **Subagent Delivery Protocol (inline-by-default)** — `=== FILE: <name> ===` delimiter pattern that works around sandbox Write denials. Explicit override of subagent default system prompts that forbid "inline fallback."
- **Behavioral vs Metric split** in Phase B.6 — mandatory two-phase validation: Phase 1 samples contracts/entities for CONFIRMED/INACCURATE/HALLUCINATED (judgment); Phase 2 independently recounts every numeric claim via `find` + `wc -l` (arithmetic, not judgment). Empirical anchor: superpowers Pass 0 round 1 claimed 32 files / 5279 LOC; recount showed 23 files / 3859 LOC.
- **Priority-ordered Lessons mandate** in Phase C — synthesis MUST include a `## Lessons for <target-project>` section with P0/P1/P2/P3 buckets, each lesson naming (a) what target does today, (b) what reference does, (c) gap, (d) specific action items with file paths. Makes the synthesis a directly actionable backlog.
- **`agents/validate-extraction.md`** updated with matching operating-mode split and two-table output format.

### Iron Laws and Red Flags rollout (Group D)

Applies superpowers' empirically-anchored behavior-shaping scaffolding to the 4 highest-stakes discipline skills. Iron Laws follow the canonical form `NO <verb> <scope> WITHOUT <prerequisite> FIRST`. Each skill gained an "Announce at Start" verbatim line and a Red Flags table enumerating the rationalizations observed during pressure testing.

- **`deliver-story`** — `NO IMPLEMENTATION WITHOUT RED GATE VERIFICATION FIRST` (+ 10 Red Flags, included in Group B rewrite)
- **`brownfield-ingest`** — `NO ROUND COMPLETION WITHOUT HONEST CONVERGENCE CHECK FIRST` (+ 10 Red Flags)
- **`adversarial-review`** — `NO APPROVAL WITHOUT FRESH-CONTEXT REVIEW FIRST` (+ 8 Red Flags targeting information-asymmetry violations)
- **`wave-gate`** — `NO WAVE ADVANCE WITHOUT ALL SIX GATES PASSING FIRST` (+ 8 Red Flags targeting threshold rounding, gate skipping, flake handling)

### AGENT-SOUL pragmatism footnote (Group E)

`docs/AGENT-SOUL.md` §8 "Pragmatism Over Ceremony" gained a footnote distinguishing **principled pragmatism** (design-time, human-in-loop, ROI-reasoning, documented) from **rationalization** (execution-time, bypass-a-rule). References superpowers' Pressure Taxonomy and the Meincke 2025 empirical anchor (N=28000, compliance 33%→72% under persuasion pressure) — which names "I'm just being pragmatic" as a first-class attack vector on discipline skills. This is the principle most easily weaponized to justify skipping Iron Laws; the footnote exists to stop that.

### Meta

- Reference analysis artifacts live in `.factory/semport/claude-code/` and `.factory/semport/superpowers/` (Phase A + B + C complete, validated).
- `TAKEAWAYS.md` and `PLUGIN-INVENTORY.md` in `.factory/semport/` document the analysis → remediation trace.
- No behavior changes to hooks, workflows, or bin helpers.
- No new tests yet — Group F bookkeeping only. Test coverage for the new Iron Law / Red Flags content is deferred.

## 0.8.0 — Wave 7: Validation infrastructure

Ships the test harness that validates the enforcement layer actually works. Previously, Wave 4's hooks and Wave 5/6's bin helpers had only smoke tests ("does it run without crashing"). Wave 7 adds allow/block path coverage.

- **41 TAP tests** across two bats files:
  - `tests/hooks.bats` (28 tests) — allow and block paths for every hook: brownfield-discipline (4), protect-vp (4), protect-bc (3), red-gate (6), purity-check (3), handoff-validator (3), regression-gate (3), session-learning (2)
  - `tests/bin.bats` (13 tests) — lobster-parse (3, including all 15 workflow files parse), research-cache (4, round-trip + determinism + normalization), multi-repo-scan (3), wave-state (3)
- **Smoke fixture** `fixtures/smoke-project/` — minimal Rust crate with one passing test, for future hook integration tests
- **Test runner** `tests/run-all.sh` — syntax checks + hook tests + bin tests; tool-guarded per `bash.md`
- **GitHub Actions CI** `.github/workflows/plugin-validation.yml` — runs on push/PR to main: installs bats/jq/yq, syntax-checks shell scripts, runs both test suites, validates all JSON manifests, parses every workflow file

All 41 tests pass on first run locally.

## 0.7.0 — Wave 6: Runtime helpers and not-portable documentation

Finishes the runtime-extension port. Ships bin helpers for the extensions that map to bash+jq+yq, wraps them in skills, and documents the four that cannot be ported.

**New bin helpers** (`plugins/vsdd-factory/bin/`):

- `research-cache` — SHA-keyed disk cache for Perplexity/Context7 query results at `.factory/research-cache/`. Subcommands: `get`, `put`, `has`, `key`, `clear`, `stats`. Ports `research-cache.ts`.
- `wave-state` — read-only query of `.factory/stories/sprint-state.yaml`. Subcommands: `current`, `stories`, `ready`, `summary`. Read-only slice of `wave-orchestrator.ts`.
- `multi-repo-scan` — detects multi-repo layouts from `.worktrees/`, reports repos with manifest types. Read-only slice of `multi-repo-orchestrator.ts`.

**New skill wrappers**:

- `research-cache-ops` — operates the research cache from within a session
- `wave-status` — reports wave readiness with recommendations
- `multi-repo-health` — detects multi-repo layouts and cross-checks against `.factory/stories/`

**Not-portable documentation** (`docs/not-portable.md`):

Documents why four dark-factory extensions cannot port to Claude Code's plugin primitives:

- `cost-tracker.ts` — no `PreModelCall` hook
- `attention-heatmap.ts` — no read-event hooks
- `tiered-context.ts` — Claude Code manages context natively
- `sidecar-learning.ts` (full synthesis) — `Stop` hook has no transcript access; partial marker-only port shipped in Wave 4

All bin helpers follow `bash.md`: `set -euo pipefail`, stderr guards, STDERR-EXEMPT tags, tool availability checks. Pass `bash -n` syntax checks and basic smoke tests.

Total skills: 91. Total bin helpers: 4.

## 0.6.0 — Wave 5: Orchestrator + workflow data (Lobster replacement)

Replaces dark-factory's Lobster workflow DSL with "Lobster-as-data" driven by the orchestrator agent and a bash helper.

- **Workflow corpus** — shipped all 15 `.lobster` files as data under `plugins/vsdd-factory/workflows/`:
  - Mode workflows: greenfield, brownfield, feature, maintenance, discovery, planning, multi-repo, code-delivery
  - Phase sub-workflows: phase-0-codebase-ingestion, phase-1-spec-crystallization, phase-3-tdd-implementation, phase-3.5-holdout-evaluation, phase-4-adversarial-refinement, phase-5-formal-hardening, phase-6-convergence
- **`bin/lobster-parse`** — bash helper wrapping `yq` + `jq` that emits workflow files as JSON with optional jq expressions. Lobster files parse cleanly as YAML.
- **Orchestrator agent updated** — added a Workflow Data section that points at the `workflows/` corpus and documents the lobster-parse helper with worked examples.
- **Five new skills** in `skills/`:
  - `run-phase` — execute a phase by reading its Lobster file and spawning declared sub-agents in dependency order
  - `next-step` — read `.factory/STATE.md` + active workflow, propose next action (does not execute)
  - `validate-workflow` — static schema check: required fields, agent/skill existence, depends_on graph, cycles, duplicate step names
  - `activate` — per-project opt-in that writes `{"agent": "vsdd-factory:orchestrator"}` to `.claude/settings.local.json`
  - `deactivate` — removes the agent override; leaves plugin enabled

Opt-in design (vs hijacking default persona on plugin enable) chosen per earlier decision — activation is always an explicit user action, per-project.

Total skills: 88.

## 0.5.0 — Wave 4: Enforcement layer (hooks)

Ported dark-factory's OpenClaw runtime extensions to Claude Code hooks. This is the "make the wrong thing impossible" wave — recovering the enforcement discipline that was missing from the initial extract.

**New hooks** (in `plugins/vsdd-factory/hooks/`):

- `brownfield-discipline.sh` (PreToolUse) — blocks edits to `.reference/**`
- `protect-bc.sh` (PreToolUse) — blocks edits to green Behavioral Contracts
- `red-gate.sh` (PreToolUse) — enforces TDD red-before-green when `.factory/red-gate-state.json` declares strict mode; opt-in per project
- `purity-check.sh` (PostToolUse, warn) — flags side-effect patterns in pure-core paths (`*/pure/**`, `*/core/**`, `*_pure.rs`, `*.pure.ts`, `*/kernel/*`)
- `regression-gate.sh` (PostToolUse) — records cargo/pytest/npm/go test outcomes to `.factory/regression-state.json`, warns on pass→fail transitions
- `handoff-validator.sh` (SubagentStop) — warns on empty/truncated subagent output
- `session-learning.sh` (Stop) — appends session-end markers to `.factory/sidecar-learning.md`

**Wired existing hooks**:

- `protect-vp.sh` (PreToolUse, Edit|Write) — already shipped, now registered
- `verify-git-push.sh` (PreToolUse, Bash) — registered
- `check-factory-commit.sh` (PreToolUse, Bash) — registered

All hooks follow `.claude/rules/bash.md`: `set -euo pipefail`, jq-based JSON parsing with stderr guards, no `eval`, tool availability checks, STDERR-EXEMPT tags where stderr suppression is intentional. All 10 hooks pass `bash -n` syntax checks and basic smoke tests.

**Not portable** (needs API-level integration Claude Code doesn't expose):

- Cost tracker, attention heatmap, tiered-context enforcement, full sidecar-learning synthesis — will ship as doc stubs in Wave 6.

## 0.4.0 — Wave 3: Design system, UX, and market intelligence

- Ported 13 skills for UI-heavy projects and product-intelligence workflows
- **Design & UX:** `design-drift-detection`, `design-system-bootstrap`, `multi-variant-design`, `storybook-mcp-integration`, `responsive-validation`, `ui-completeness-check`, `ui-quality-gate`, `ux-heuristic-evaluation`
- **Market & customer:** `competitive-monitoring`, `customer-feedback-ingestion`, `intelligence-synthesis`, `market-intelligence-assessment`, `analytics-integration`
- `templates/design-system/` already present from initial extraction

Total skills: 83.

## 0.3.0 — Wave 2: Skill coverage (feature-mode + maintenance)

- Ported 39 skills from dark-factory workflow catalogue
- **Feature-mode (F1–F7):** `phase-f1-delta-analysis`, `phase-f2-spec-evolution`, `phase-f3-incremental-stories`, `phase-f4-delta-implementation`, `phase-f5-scoped-adversarial`, `phase-f6-targeted-hardening`, `phase-f7-delta-convergence`
- **Maintenance & discovery:** `maintenance-sweep`, `discovery-engine`, `planning-research`, `post-feature-validation`, `pr-review-triage`, `fix-pr-delivery`
- **Mode routing:** `mode-decision-guide`, `quick-dev-routing`, `feature-mode-scoping-rules`, `implementation-readiness`, `validate-brief`
- **Infrastructure:** `model-routing`, `repo-initialization`, `toolchain-provisioning`, `wave-scheduling`, `spec-versioning`, `traceability-extension`, `sdk-generation`
- **Session & consistency:** `consistency-validation`, `convergence-tracking`, `artifact-detection`, `phase-1-prd-revision`, `phase-1d-adversarial-spec-review`, `multi-repo-phase-0-synthesis`, `factory-worktree-health`, `dtu-creation`, `brainstorming`, `agent-file-review`, `code-delivery`, `demo-recording`, `session-review`, `guided-brief-creation`
- Replaced Corverax's `release` skill with dark-factory's authoritative version per merge rules

Total skills: 70 (was 31).

## 0.2.0 — Wave 1: Foundation

- Shipped `docs/VSDD.md`, `docs/FACTORY.md`, `docs/CONVERGENCE.md` — the methodology documents
- Shipped `docs/AGENT-SOUL.md` — shared engine-wide agent principles
- Ported 28 dark-factory agents into single-file triune format (`## Identity` + `## Operating Procedure`) with synthesized frontmatter:
  `accessibility-auditor, architect, business-analyst, code-reviewer, consistency-validator, data-engineer, demo-recorder, devops-engineer, dtu-validator, dx-engineer, e2e-tester, formal-verifier, github-ops, implementer, performance-engineer, pr-manager, pr-reviewer, product-owner, security-reviewer, session-review, spec-reviewer, spec-steward, state-manager, story-writer, technical-writer, test-writer, ux-designer, visual-reviewer`
- Shipped `agents/orchestrator/` as a directory containing `orchestrator.md` plus 9 mode-sequence sub-files (greenfield, brownfield, feature, maintenance, discovery, multi-repo, per-story-delivery, steady-state, heartbeat)
- Kept Corverax's enhanced versions of the 5 overlapping agents (adversary, codebase-analyzer, holdout-evaluator, research-agent, validate-extraction) unchanged

Total agents: 34 (33 dark-factory + 1 Corverax addition).

## 0.1.0 — Initial marketplace

- Extracted Corverax `.claude/` VSDD pipeline into a shareable plugin marketplace
- 5 agents, 31 skills, 3 hooks, rules, templates
